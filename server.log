8:01:14 PM [express] POST /api/youtube/transcript 200 in 2190ms :: {"transcript":"data structures are super important to know for technical coding interviews and computer science in general and so in this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're

While they are crucial for solving complex problems and excelling in technical interviews, it's often unclear how to choose the right one for the job. This lecture will cut through that confusion, demystifying popular data structures and equipping you with the vital tools to understand and measure their real-world performance.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe foundational understanding of data structures is critical for success in computer science and technical interviews. A key concept for evaluating their efficiency is Big O notation, which measures an algorithm's time complexity. This measurement categorizes performance into several types: O(1) for constant time operations, akin to a rocket ship instantly accessing a specific item regardless of data size; O(n) for linear time, where execution time scales directly with the amount of data, like exhaustively searching a list; O(n^2) for quadratic time, signifying rapidly increasing time as data size grows, such as when every element interacts with every other; and O(log n) for logarithmic time, a highly efficient approach where the search space is halved repeatedly, much like finding a word in a dictionary. Building on this, basic data structures include arrays, which store data contiguously in fixed-size blocks, offering O(1) access by index but incurring O(n) costs for resizing or shifting elements during insertion and deletion. In contrast, linked lists provide flexibility by connecting individual nodes, allowing O(1) insertion and deletion when a node's reference is known, yet requiring O(n) traversal for accessing elements. Specialized linear structures like stacks (Last-In, First-Out) and queues (First-In, First-Out) restrict operations to their respective ends, ensuring highly efficient O(1) insertion and deletion for managing ordered data, with practical applications in algorithms like Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search.\n\nAdvancing to more complex data structures, heaps, often used as priority queues, are tree-based structures that maintain a specific ordering property, ensuring O(log n) efficiency for both insertion and deletion by dynamically rebalancing their structure. Hash maps, also known as dictionaries, employ hash functions to store data as key-value pairs, achieving an average O(1) time complexity for access, insertion, and deletion. This speed, however, can degrade to O(n) in the worst-case scenario due to hash collisions, where multiple keys map to the same location, necessitating collision resolution strategies. Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are another tree-like structure where each node strictly adheres to an ordering rule (left children smaller, right children larger), which enables efficient O(log n) average time for searching, inserting, and deleting elements by effectively halving the search space at each step. Yet, an unbalanced BST can devolve into a linked list, causing operations to become O(n). Finally, sets are unordered collections designed to store unique elements, typically implemented using hash tables. They offer an average O(1) time for checking an element's existence, insertion, and deletion, similar to hash maps but focused on membership and uniqueness, making them invaluable for tasks like removing duplicates or performing mathematical set operations. Understanding these distinct structures and their performance characteristics is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and solving complex problems.\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n- Big O notation measures the speed and efficiency (time complexity) of data structure operations.\n- Common Big O complexities include O(1) (constant), O(log n) (logarithmic), O(n) (linear), and O(n^2) (quadratic).\n- Arrays store data contiguously with a fixed size, allowing O(1) access by index but O(n) for inserting/deleting in the middle due to shifting.\n- Linked lists use nodes with pointers, offering flexible size and O(1) insertion/deletion (with reference) but O(n) access as elements must be traversed.\n- Stacks follow a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, where pushing and popping elements from the top are O(1) operations.\n- Queues follow a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, with O(1) operations for adding to the back (enqueue) and removing from the front (dequeue).\n- Heaps (priority queues) are tree-like structures (Min/Max Heap) where insertion and removal of the top element are O(log n) operations.\n- Hashmaps (dictionaries) store key-value pairs using a hash function, providing O(1) average time for access, insertion, and deletion, but O(n) worst-case due to collisions.\n- Binary Search Trees (BSTs) order nodes (left < parent < right), enabling O(log n) average time for searching, insertion, and deletion.\n- Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, typically implemented with hash tables for O(1) average time complexity for existence checks, insertion, and deletion."}

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're

This lecture will demystify popular data structures, showing what they are and how they work with real-world applications. Critically, we'll understand the precise method for measuring their speed and efficiency, clearing up any confusion about their performance in different scenarios.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nUnderstanding data structures is fundamental in computer science, with their efficiency typically measured using Big O notation, which quantifies an algorithm's speed based on input size. This notation highlights four key performance categories: O(1) constant time, the fastest, where operations take uniform time regardless of data size (e.g., retrieving the first item on a list); O(N) linear time, where execution time grows proportionally with data (e.g., searching for an item in an unsorted list); O(N^2) quadratic time, significantly slower, where operations involve interaction between every pair of elements (e.g., all students shaking hands); and O(log N) logarithmic time, faster than linear but slower than constant, where the data search space is repeatedly halved (e.g., finding a word in a dictionary). Different data structures are optimized for varying scenarios, similar to how different vehicles are suited for different travel needs.\n\nThe lecture then delves into common data structures, starting with linear types. An **array** is like a row of lockers, storing data contiguously in fixed-size blocks. This allows for O(1) access to any element by its index, but insertions or deletions in the middle require shifting subsequent elements, leading to O(N) complexity (unless at the end, which is O(1)), and resizing a full array is also O(N). In contrast, a **linked list**, akin to a train, consists of interconnected nodes, offering flexibility as elements can be added or removed without shifting. However, accessing an element by index necessitates traversing the list from the beginning, resulting in O(N) access time, though insertion or deletion is O(1) if a reference to the target node is already available. **Stacks** operate on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, like a pile of chips where only the top is accessible, enabling O(1) operations for adding (push) or removing (pop) elements, but O(N) for searching or accessing internal elements. Similarly, **queues** follow a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) rule, like a line at a store, supporting O(1) operations for adding (enqueue) to the back and removing (dequeue) from the front, with O(N) for internal access.\n\nMoving to more complex and non-linear structures, a **heap** (or priority queue) functions like a pyramid of boxes, maintaining a specific order (e.g., smallest at the top for a Min Heap). Accessing the top element is O(1), while inserting or deleting elements involves \"bubbling\" them up or down to restore the heap property, resulting in O(log N) efficiency due to its balanced binary tree structure. **Hashmaps** (or dictionaries) act like a mailroom with dedicated mailboxes for employees; they store key-value pairs using a hash function to map keys to memory locations. This typically provides O(1) average time for access, insertion, and deletion, but can degrade to O(N) in the worst-case scenario due to hash collisions requiring linear probing or chaining. A **binary search tree (BST)**, like a family tree with specific ordering rules (left children smaller, right children larger), allows for efficient O(log N) average-case search, insertion, and deletion by eliminating half the remaining tree at each step, though an unbalanced tree can degrade to O(N). Finally, a **set**, analogous to Thanos's Infinity Gauntlet, is an unordered collection of unique elements, often implemented using hash tables. It provides O(1) average time for checking element existence, insertion, and deletion due to its reliance on hashing, but similarly faces O(N) worst-case performance under severe collisions. Sets are particularly useful for tasks like removing duplicates or checking membership due to their inherent uniqueness property.\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n- Data structures are fundamental for technical coding interviews and computer science, with Big O notation used to measure their speed and efficiency.\n- Big O notation describes algorithm performance: O(1) constant time (fastest), O(N) linear time (predictable growth), O(N^2) quadratic time (slowest), and O(log N) logarithmic time (very efficient, cutting search space by half).\n- An array stores data contiguously with fixed positions, allowing O(1) access by index, but O(N) for inserting/deleting if shifting or resizing is required.\n- A linked list uses nodes connected by pointers, making element access O(N) (requiring traversal), but insertion/deletion can be O(1) if the reference is known, without resizing issues.\n- A stack is a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure where pushing (inserting) and popping (removing) elements from the top are O(1) operations.\n- A queue is a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) structure where enqueuing (adding to the back) and dequeuing (removing from the front) elements are O(1) operations.\n- A heap (min or max) is a tree-based structure maintaining a parent-child relationship property; accessing the root is O(1), and inserting or removing elements is O(log N).\n- A hashmap stores key-value pairs using a hash function; average-case accessing, inserting, and deleting are O(1), but can be O(N) worst-case due to hash collisions.\n- A binary search tree is ordered, with left children smaller and right children larger than the parent; average-case access, insertion, and deletion are O(log N), but O(N) in unbalanced worst-case scenarios.\n- A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, often hash-table based; average-case checking for existence, inserting, and deleting are O(1), but O(N) worst-case due to collisions."}

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're

3:30:17 PM [express] POST /api/ai/summary 200 in 29634ms :: {"summary":"Introduction\n\nWelcome to this essential lecture on data structures, a cornerstone of computer science and a critical skill for any technical interview. We'll explore why these foundational tools are so important for building efficient software. This session will clarify what popular data structures are, how they operate, and critically, how to choose the most effective one for any given problem.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe lecture introduces fundamental data structures as crucial components for technical interviews and computer science, emphasizing their efficiency measured by Big O notation. This notation categorizes algorithm speed: O(1) or constant time represents instantaneous operations, like retrieving the first item from a list, regardless of its size. O(log N), or logarithmic time, is slightly slower but highly efficient, akin to rapidly finding a word in a dictionary by repeatedly halving the search space. O(N), or linear time, signifies that operation time scales directly with the data size, such as searching for an item in an unsorted list. Lastly, O(N^2), or quadratic time, is the least efficient, where every element must interact with every other, exemplified by a scenario like every student shaking hands with every other student, leading to a drastically increased workload with more data.\n\nThe discussion then delves into common data structures, starting with arrays, which store data contiguously like a row of lockers, allowing O(1) direct access by index. However, inserting an element beyond the array's current capacity or deleting an element from the middle can be O(N) due to the need to create a new array and copy elements or shift existing ones. In contrast, linked lists, resembling a train with connected cars, offer O(1) insertion or deletion if a reference to the adjacent node is already available, as only pointers need re-linking. Yet, accessing an arbitrary element or inserting/deleting without a prior reference requires O(N) traversal from the beginning, highlighting a key trade-off with arrays: flexibility in size versus direct access speed. Specialized linear structures include stacks, which follow a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle like a stack of chips, making both \"pushing\" (adding) and \"popping\" (removing from the top) O(1) operations. Queues, conversely, operate on a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) basis, similar to a checkout line, where \"enqueuing\" (adding to the back) and \"dequeuing\" (removing from the front) are also O(1). For both stacks and queues, any operation requiring access to or search for an internal element (not at the ends) is O(N) due to the lack of direct indexing.\n\nFinally, the lecture explores more advanced data structures. Heaps, structured like a pyramid with specific parent-child value relationships (e.g., smallest at the top for a Min-Heap), provide O(log N) efficiency for inserting and deleting elements by \"bubbling\" them into their correct position, making them more efficient than linear structures for these operations. Hash maps, often called dictionaries, use a hash function to store key-value pairs in dedicated \"mailboxes,\" enabling average O(1) access, insertion, and deletion. The main challenge lies in \"hash collisions,\" where multiple keys map to the same location, which can degrade worst-case performance to O(N) if a linear search through a chained list is required. Binary search trees (BSTs) organize data hierarchically where left children are smaller and right children are larger than their parent, allowing O(log N) operations for searching, insertion, and deletion by continually eliminating half the remaining tree. However, an unbalanced BST can devolve into O(N) performance, resembling a linked list. Lastly, sets, akin to Thanos's Infinity Gauntlet for unique stones, are unordered collections of unique elements typically backed by hash tables, offering average O(1) for checking existence, insertion, and deletion, invaluable for tasks like removing duplicates or membership testing, but susceptible to O(N) worst-case performance in the event of severe hash collisions.\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n- Data structures are crucial for technical coding interviews and computer science.\n- Big O notation is used to measure the speed and efficiency (time complexity) of data structures and algorithms.\n- O(1) (constant time) is the fastest, meaning operation time is independent of the data size.\n- O(n) (linear time) means operation time grows proportionally with the amount of data.\n- O(log n) (logarithmic time) operations are faster than O(n) but slower than O(1), often halving the search space.\n- An Array stores data contiguously, providing O(1) access by index but O(n) for inserting/deleting elements (unless at the end) due to shifting or resizing.\n- A Linked List uses nodes with values and pointers, offering O(1) insertion/deletion (with reference) but O(n) access as it requires traversal.\n- A Stack follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle; pushing (inserting) and popping (deleting) elements from the top are O(1).\n- A Queue follows a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle; enqueuing (adding to back) and dequeuing (removing from front) are O(1).\n- A Heap (Priority Queue) maintains a specific parent-child relationship (Min or Max Heap), making insertion and removal O(log n).\n- A Hashmap (Dictionary) stores key-value pairs using a hash function, providing average O(1) time for accessing, inserting, and deleting elements by key.\n- Hashmap operations can degrade to O(n) in the worst case due to hash collisions.\n- A Binary Search Tree (BST) orders nodes (left child < parent, right child > parent), enabling average O(log n) for access, insertion, and deletion.\n- A Set is an unordered collection of unique elements, often implemented with a hash table, offering average O(1) for checking existence, insertion, and deletion."}

3:41:41 PM [express] POST /api/youtube/transcript 200 in 1857ms :: {"transcript":"data structures are super important to know for technical coding interviews and computer science in general and so in this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're

3:42:11 PM [express] POST /api/ai/summary 200 in 25738ms :: {"summary":"Introduction\n\nData structures are absolutely fundamental to computer science and essential for technical interviews. In this lecture, we'll explore what these core structures look like and how they operate, but more importantly, we'll tackle the biggest question: how do we objectively measure their efficiency to choose the right tool for any coding challenge?\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nUnderstanding the efficiency of data structures is fundamental in computer science and technical interviews, with \"Big O\" notation serving as the universal metric for measuring an algorithm's speed and operational cost in varying scenarios. This system categorizes performance into distinct types: O(1) constant time, representing instantaneous operations regardless of data size, akin to retrieving the first item on any length grocery list; O(N) linear time, where processing time scales directly with the amount of data, like searching for a specific name in an unsorted list; O(N^2) quadratic time, denoting significantly slower operations where every data item interacts with every other, exemplified by every student in a classroom shaking hands; and O(log N) logarithmic time, which is faster than linear but slower than constant, achieved by repeatedly halving the search space, much like finding a word in a dictionary. Just as different vehicles are optimized for different travel needs, various data structures are best suited for particular computational tasks, each with distinct time complexities for common operations.\n\nSeveral foundational data structures offer diverse trade-offs in performance. The **array**, structured like a row of fixed-position lockers, stores elements contiguously in memory, enabling O(1) direct access by index. However, its fixed size means that inserting an element into a full array or deleting one mid-array can be an expensive O(N) operation due to the need for resizing and shifting, unless appending or deleting from the end which can be O(1). In contrast, a **linked list**, resembling a train with connected cars, consists of separate nodes pointing to the next, offering flexibility in size and efficient O(1) insertion/deletion if the relevant node's reference is known, as no shifting is required. However, accessing a specific element requires O(N) traversal from the beginning. **Stacks** operate on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, like a pile of chips, allowing only O(1) additions (push) and removals (pop) from the top, making them highly efficient for specific scenarios like depth-first search, but O(N) for general searching. Similarly, **queues** adhere to a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) rule, mirroring a line at a store, with O(1) additions to the back and removals from the front, commonly used in breadth-first search and task scheduling.\n\nMoving to more complex structures, the **heap** (or priority queue) organizes data like a pyramid, ensuring the smallest (Min Heap) or largest (Max Heap) element is always at the top. While accessing an arbitrary element is O(N), retrieving the top element is O(1). Its balanced binary tree structure allows for efficient O(log N) insertion and deletion, as elements \"bubble up\" or \"bubble down\" to maintain heap properties, offering better performance than linear structures for ordered data management. The **hashmap** (or dictionary in Python) uses key-value pairs and a hash function to map keys to specific storage locations, enabling average O(1) access, insertion, and deletion, much like designated mailboxes. This makes lookups exceptionally fast; however, \"hash collisions\" (multiple keys mapping to the same location) can degrade performance to O(N) in the worst case if not efficiently resolved. A **binary search tree (BST)** organizes data hierarchically, with rules ensuring all left children are smaller and right children are larger than their parent, which facilitates efficient O(log N) average-case searching, insertion, and deletion by continuously halving the search space. Yet, an unbalanced tree can degenerate into a linked list, leading to O(N) worst-case performance. Finally, a **set** functions as an unordered collection of unique elements, often implemented using hash tables. It excels at O(1) average-case checks for element existence, insertion, and deletion, making it invaluable for tasks like deduplication or membership testing. However, like hashmaps, severe hash collisions can lead to O(N) worst-case scenarios. Each data structure, therefore, presents a unique combination of strengths and weaknesses, making informed selection critical for optimizing algorithm performance.\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n- Data structures are crucial for technical coding interviews and computer science, with Big O notation used to measure their speed and efficiency.\n- Big O notation includes O(1) constant time (fastest), O(N) linear time, O(N^2) quadratic time (slowest), and O(log N) logarithmic time (efficient, halves search space).\n- An **Array** stores data contiguously in fixed-size memory, allowing O(1) access by index, but O(N) for inserting/deleting elements that require shifting or resizing.\n- A **Linked List** uses nodes with values and pointers, offering flexible size and O(1) insertion/deletion if the reference is known, but O(N) for accessing or searching elements.\n- A **Stack** follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, enabling O(1) 'push' (insertion) and 'pop' (deletion) operations from the top.\n- A **Queue** follows a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, allowing O(1) 'enqueue' (add to back) and 'dequeue' (remove from front) operations.\n- A **Heap** (Priority Queue) is a tree-like structure (Min/Max Heap) where the top element is always the smallest/largest, supporting O(log N) insertion and deletion by bubbling up/down.\n- A **Hashmap** (dictionary) stores key-value pairs using a hash function, providing O(1) average time complexity for access, insertion, and deletion by key, but O(N) in worst-case collisions.\n- A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** orders nodes such that left children are smaller and right children are larger than their parent, achieving O(log N) average time for access, insertion, and deletion, but O(N) if unbalanced.\n- A **Set** is an unordered collection of unique elements, typically implemented with hash tables, offering O(1) average time for checking existence, insertion, and deletion, useful for membership checks and removing duplicates."}

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're

Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually

being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the

pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're interested in leveling up your career applying your data structures knowledge two actual leite code problems that show up in top Tech interviews for companies like Amazon or Google you might want to

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you

too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because

last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're interested in leveling up your career applying your data structures knowledge two actual leite code problems that show up in top Tech interviews for companies like Amazon or Google you might want to

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity

have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the

start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're interested in leveling up your career applying your data structures knowledge two actual leite code problems that show up in top Tech interviews for companies like Amazon or Google you might want to

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is

you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked

you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're interested in leveling up your career applying your data structures knowledge two actual leite code problems that show up in top Tech interviews for companies like Amazon or Google you might want to

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item

it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're interested in leveling up your career applying your data structures knowledge two actual leite code problems that show up in top Tech interviews for companies like Amazon or Google you might want to

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so

example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so

with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and

used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're

It delves into their operational mechanics, real-world applications, and, crucially, their time complexity analysis using Big O notation. Understanding these concepts is essential for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance.\",\n  \"summary\": \"The lecture begins by introducing Big O notation as a fundamental concept for measuring the speed and efficiency of data structures and algorithms in various scenarios. Four key time complexities are explained: O(1) constant time, representing operations that take the same amount of time regardless of data size (e.g., accessing the first element of a list); O(n) linear time, where execution time grows proportionally with the input data (e.g., searching for an element in an unsorted list); O(n^2) quadratic time, indicating that time grows quadratically with data, making it very inefficient for large datasets (e.g., every item interacting with every other item); and O(log n) logarithmic time, which is faster than linear but slower than constant, often seen in algorithms that halve the search space with each step (e.g., looking up a word in a dictionary).\",\n  \"summary\": \"The lecture then systematically covers several popular data structures. Arrays store data in contiguous memory, allowing O(1) access by index but O(n) for resizing or deleting from the middle. Linked lists, conversely, use separate nodes with pointers, offering O(1) insertion/deletion (if a reference is available) but O(n) for accessing elements by index. Stacks adhere to a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, providing O(1) push and pop operations, while Queues follow a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, also with O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations. Heaps (priority queues) are tree-like structures that maintain a specific order (Min-Heap or Max-Heap), enabling O(log n) insertion and deletion by bubbling elements up or down.\",\n  \"summary\": \"Hash Maps (or Dictionaries) store key-value pairs using a hash function for extremely efficient O(1) average-case access, insertion, and deletion, though hash collisions can degrade performance to O(n) in the worst case. Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are organized such that left children are smaller than the parent and right children are larger, leading to O(log n) average-case time for searching, insertion, and deletion by effectively halving the search space. However, an unbalanced BST can degenerate to O(n) complexity. Finally, Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, typically implemented using hash tables, offering O(1) average-case time for checking existence, insertion, and deletion, making them highly efficient for membership checks and duplicate removal.\"\n  \"keypoints\": [\n    \"Big O notation (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)) measures algorithm efficiency.\",\n    \"Arrays offer O(1) indexed access but O(n) for resizing or middle deletions due to contiguous memory.\",\n    \"Linked Lists provide O(1) insertion/deletion (with reference) but O(n) for element access due to sequential traversal.\",\n    \"Stacks (LIFO) and Queues (FIFO) enable O(1) operations for adding and removing elements from specific ends.\",\n    \"Heaps (Priority Queues) maintain order in a tree-like structure, allowing O(log n) insertion and deletion.\",\n    \"Hash Maps (Dictionaries) use hash functions for O(1) average-case access, insertion, and deletion, but can be O(n) in worst-case collision scenarios.\",\n    \"Binary Search Trees (BSTs) leverage ordering rules for O(log n) average-case search, insert, and delete, becoming O(n) if unbalanced.\",\n    \"Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, typically using hash tables for O(1) average-case operations like checking existence, insertion, and deletion.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"}

this video I'm going to be breaking down some of the most popular data structures out there what they look like and how they operate real world examples so you can actually picture what I'm talking about plus their time complexities but more on that later and if you're new here hi my name is zad I have a bachelor's and Masters in computer science from Georgia Tech I have software engineering experience working at top tech companies like Amazon and every single day I help hundreds of thousands of people break into Tech before we get into any particular particular data structure we do need to understand one big concept called Big O this is our way of measuring speed and efficiency how well data structures are actually operating in different scenarios for example if I'm in New York and I want to go to California I could walk there it might take me a month I could bike there in a couple weeks I could drive there in a few days or I could fly there in just a few hours different vehicles are optimized for different scenarios just like different data structures are also optimized for different scenarios but for vehicles we measured the by Miles hour but for the speed of data structures and how they operate we use time complexity or Big O notation if you're not understanding this let me break down four different types of Big O notation first one we got o of one constant time this is the fastest an algorithm can operate think like rocket ship speed of light o of one means the operation takes the same amount of time no matter how much data there is imagine you have a grocery list and you want to grab just the first item on the list whether that list is five items 500 items 5,000 items the operation is the same exact thing you just need to take the first one instantly there's no extra effort despite how long the list is so it's super fast and super efficient a level above that we have o of n linear time where n in this case represents the amount of data that we have this is still a pretty fast operation so you can imagine not speed of light but like superar and specifically o of n this is when the amount of data increases the time it takes grows at that same rate for example if you have a list of names and you need to find a specific name the worst case is you have to check every single name until you find that name if you have a list of 10 names you might have to do 10 checks if there are a th000 names you might have to do 1,000 checks we don't know the position in the list like we did for the O of one scenario and so as the data increases in size it takes longer cuz there's just a longer operation just more to deal with but it's a very predictable increase a level above that we have quadratic time o of n s think of biking from New York to California I mean like very very slow and this happens when every single item in a data set needs to interact with every other item imagine you have a classroom full of students and each student has to shake hands with every other student if there are 10 students that means 10 * 10 100 handshakes if there are 100 students that is 100 * 100 10,000 handshakes the amount of work this operation has to go through grows way too fast the more students that are added into the mix and if you have an algorithm that takes o of n^2 time complexity just know that's a really slow really bad algorithm and chances are there's a better scenario now the fourth scenario I want to talk about is a slight curve ball and that is O of log n logarithmic time and this one is faster than o of n but slower than o of one so it's not the speed of light it's like the speed of sound it's still really fast an example for you to understand this is Imagine trying to look up a word in the dictionary typically if you have like a random word what people generally do is they open up the dictionary to the middle somewhere in the middle and from there you decide does the word I'm looking for come before or after the current page I'm on and so depending on that you'll jump forward or backward and you'll repeat that process until you find your desired word each time we're jumping Pages we're cutting the amount of time that we're looking in our search by a half we're not going through every single page in a dictionary that would be o of n but rather we're going half and then half of that half of that and the search space of the operation just gets smaller and smaller and actually if you look at a logarithm graph at a certain point as you keep increasing the input the difference in the output is so small and so marginal and so these are the different time complexities that different data structures can have and now that we understand how things are getting measured let's start off with our first data structure and we're going to be talking about the array think of an array like a row of middle school lockers each Locker has a fixed position and you can quickly go to any one of them just by knowing its number arrays store data in a contiguous manner meaning all elements are placed side by side by side in memory because each element has a specific index retrieving a value is extremely fast and you can go directly to its position without like searching however if the array is already full and you want to add a new element that can be a little tricky cuz you can't just squeeze another item it's a fixed size just like you can't add a new Locker you might have to break down a wall similarly you need to create a new larger array and all existing elements must be copied over and then the new element can be added but there is a structure that's similar to an array that handles this resizing a little bit better if you know which one I'm talking about and why it's better let me know in the comments down below and I might give you a shout out in my next video in terms of time complexities accessing any element by an index is an O of one operation so it's super efficient inserting an element at a position is also o of one if you're simply replacing an existing item but inserting a value beyond the array side requires creating a whole another array which takes o of n time cuz you have to copy over a whole array deleting an element is also o of nend because once an element is removed all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure unless you're deleting at the very end of the array in that case it's an O of one because you're just removing the last element and there's no shifting downwards the next data structure we're going to be talking about is the linked list think of a linked list like a train where each car is connected to the next one if you if you want to reach a specific car you can't just teleport to it you have to start from the front and move through each car until you find the one that you need in link list each element is stored in a separate node and each node contains both a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence this makes link list more flexible than arrays since you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting everything around however accessing specific elements is slower because you have to Traverse the list from the beginning to find it so in terms of time comple accessing an element by an index is an O of n operation because you actually have to go through the list there's no index inbuilt into the link list inserting an element at a position is an O of one operation if you already have reference to the node that you're trying to insert around but if you actually have to search for it once again you're traversing the list so that's going to be an O of n operation deleting an element similar to inserting is O of one if you have the right reference because all you have to do is just switch around the pointers but if you have to search for that reference it's an O of n operation once again the nice thing is unlike an array deleting from a linked list doesn't require shifting elements around so sometimes it can be a little more efficient in this type of use case plus there's also no resizing issue because it's just nodes and pointers there's no like fixed structures that you have to deal with the next data structure we're going to talk about is the stack this is a simple structure that follows a last in first out principle meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed think of a stack of chips you have to eat the top one first before you can e the next one each element in a stack is stored in an ordered manner but unlike arrays you can only access or modify elements from the top of the stack this makes retrieval and insertion extremely efficient because there's no shifting around for the Big O time complexity for a stack there's no accessing really at a particular index because you only take or remove from the top itself but if you have to access or search through a stack that would be an O of n operation because you have to go through each element one by one by one there's no indexing inserting an element which is called pushing onto the stack is an O of one operation because you simply add the element to the top of the stack without affecting any other structure within the stack deleting an element which is called popping from the stack once again is an O of one operation because you only have to remove from the top of the element there's no dealing with the other elements when you're taking or removing from a stack so it's highly efficient for adding or removing plus it's very widely used in depth for search but more on that later the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Q and unlike a stack that was last and first out this is a first and first out which means the first element added is the first element to be removed think of it when you're standing in line at the store the person at the front gets to the checkout first and then they get dealt with first any new people that want to join the line has to join in in the back and must wait their turn till they come to the front each element in a queue is stored in an ordered manner but unlike an array which is also ordered these elements can be added only in the back and removed in the front for the Big O time complexity of a que just like a stack you can't access element by their index but for some reason if you have to go through the whole queue to find a certain element that would be an O of n operation to access or search if you're not just trying to access the first element there in terms of insertion or deltion those are o of one operations because you add to the back remove from the front and it's just continuous think of a stack but in slight reverse order plus qes are highly used in breath th search and Spotify music the next data structure we're going to talk about is the Heap or priority CU think of a heap like a pyramid of stacked boxes where the smallest Box is always at the very top you don't randomly grab a box from the middle you always take from the top but specifically for heaps they actually always need a box to be at the top like if any boxes are removed within the pyramid they need to readjust so there's a box still at the top so it can maintain that structure also there are two types of heaps that you need to know first is a Min Heap where every parent is smaller than its children and the top element is the smallest while in a Max Heap every parent is larger than its children and the top element is the largest for efficiency accessing an element by its index is not a general operation but if needed it would be o of one to access the top element which we call the root and O of n for any arbitrary elements within the Heap inserting an element is a o of login procedure because first it's added into the Heap and then because of the Heap property of the parent child ration ship being bigger or smaller it bubbles up to its right position similarly removing is also o of login because it removes the elements and then bubbles down to restore the Heap property and since heaps are actually balanced binary trees which more on that later both insertion and deletion operations are extremely efficient compared to linear data structures like arrays or link lists which we talked about the next data structure we're going to talk about is the hashmap and make sure you know this one think of a hashmap like a mail room in an office where every empy employee has a dedicated mailbox instead of sorting through all the mail one by one by one you just look oh John his mailbox is number four Sally her mailbox is number five you know exactly where to put it and John and Sally know exactly where to access it a hashmap stores data using key value pairs where each key is run through a hash function that determines where the value should be stored an example of a hash function could be the length of a string so John's name for example is four characters long so he's in position four Sally is in position five her name is five characters long this makes lookups on hash Maps extremely efficient time complexity wise being 0 of one however if too many items hash to the same mailbox which we call a hash Collision for example if a new employee Andy joins well his name is also four letters we can't just put him in position number four because that's where JN is so we need to have a hash Collision resolution which could be a linkless chaining from the hashmap position or it could be linear probing where you find the next available position either way this is the only real downside to hashmaps otherwise they are super super efficient as a data structure so overall accessing an element by its key in a hashmap is an O of one operation but it could be o of n worst case if everything is put onto that link list and you have to do a lot of searching inserting an element is an O of one operation but worst case scenario that could end up being o ofen deleting an element is also an O of one operation because if you have the right key you can just go to the value but if there is a long length list that you have to deal with to find the actual element that you're dealing with that could end up being an O of end operation by the way if you use Python you probably call hashmaps dictionaries but they're pretty much the same thing the next data structure we're going to talk about is the binary search tree so it's a tree it looks similar to a family tree but the key difference is each node follows a specific ordering rule the left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent this makes searching insertion and deletion extremely efficient in terms of the Big O accessing inserting and deleting into a binary search tree is an O of login procedure because of the rules of the left parent and right needing to be less than one another while we're dealing with the elements every time we look to access an element insert an element or delete an element you can literally eliminate half the tree as we're going through it so it's like going through the dictionary trying to find that word because you're just splitting up your search Space by half every layer that you're going but worst case if your binary search tree is unbalanced for some reason and it looks something something similar to a link list each of those operations access insertion and deletion becomes o of n because you might have to go through each element there's no elimination of search space the next data structure we're going to talk about is the set and I want you to think of this like thanos's Infinity Gauntlet it can hold powerful stones but each stone is unique if Thanos tries to add the same Stone twice it simply won't work because the gauntlet can only allow one of each kind also the order in which he collects the stones doesn't matter matter at all as long as like he has all the stones in whatever order they're all unique it'll be good sets are very useful if you're searching through trees or you're searching through graphs and you want to keep track of if you visited a certain node or not and overall the definition of a set is an unordered collection of unique elements typically implemented using a hash table similarly the efficiency of a hash map with the hash function this makes checking for the existence of an element extremely fast which means 0 of one on average time however similar to all the issues that we had with the hash function and the hash Maps causing potential collisions that can take it all the way up to O of n unlike a razor link list sets don't store duplicates and they don't maintain a specific order and in fact they're actually used for a lot of coding interview questions such as removing duplicates from a link list removing duplicates from a data set or checking for a certain membership or performing mathematical set operations so make sure you know your sets because it's never going to be the main data structure but it's always going to be something to have in handy just like thanos's Gauntlet in terms of the Big O time complexity in inserting and deleting are going to be o of one operations because of the whole hash function but if there's so many cash collisions once again it's going to be o ofn worst case just like it was for the hashmap and that's if the case is it's run by hash tables in the background there are various other ways to create sets I just gave you an example of a hash set and if you're interested in leveling up your career applying your data structures knowledge two actual leite code problems that show up in top Tech interviews for companies like Amazon or Google you might want to

Four key types are explained: O(1) Constant Time, the fastest, meaning an operation's time is independent of data size (e.g., accessing the first item in a list). O(n) Linear Time indicates that operation time scales directly with the amount of data (e.g., searching an unsorted list). O(n^2) Quadratic Time signifies a significantly slower operation where every item interacts with every other item, causing time to grow quadratically with data size. Lastly, O(log n) Logarithmic Time is presented as faster than linear but slower than constant, where the search space is halved with each step, exemplified by dictionary lookups.\n\nFollowing Big O, various data structures are explored. An **Array** is like a row of lockers, storing data contiguously with O(1) access by index. However, insertion/deletion requiring resizing or shifting elements typically takes O(n) time. A **Linked List**, like a train, consists of nodes connected by pointers, offering O(n) access as traversal is required. Its flexibility allows O(1) insertion/deletion if the reference is known, without element shifting. The **Stack** follows a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, enabling O(1) push (insert) and pop (delete) operations from the top. Conversely, the **Queue** adheres to a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, with O(1) enqueue (add to back) and dequeue (remove from front) operations.\n\nThe discussion then moves to more complex structures. A **Heap** (Priority Queue) maintains a specific parent-child ordering (Min-Heap or Max-Heap), making insertion and deletion O(log n) due to the 'bubbling' process to restore heap properties. **Hashmaps** (dictionaries in Python) store key-value pairs using a hash function, providing average O(1) access, insertion, and deletion. However, hash collisions can degrade performance to O(n) in the worst-case. A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** organizes data such that left children are smaller and right children are larger than their parent, allowing O(log n) average time for access, insertion, and deletion by efficiently pruning the search space. An unbalanced BST, however, can degenerate to O(n) performance. Finally, a **Set** is an unordered collection of unique elements, often implemented using hash tables, offering average O(1) for checking existence, insertion, and deletion, with worst-case O(n) in collision scenarios.\n\n### Key Points\n- Big O notation measures algorithm efficiency: O(1) constant, O(log n) logarithmic, O(n) linear, O(n^2) quadratic.\n- Arrays offer O(1) direct access by index but O(n) for insertion/deletion requiring resizing or shifting.\n- Linked Lists provide O(1) insertion/deletion (with reference) but O(n) for access due to sequential traversal.\n- Stacks (LIFO) and Queues (FIFO) facilitate O(1) operations (push/pop, enqueue/dequeue) at their ends.\n- Heaps (Priority Queues) and Binary Search Trees (BSTs) leverage ordering rules for O(log n) average time complexity for key operations (insertion, deletion, search).\n- Hashmaps (Dictionaries) and Sets provide average O(1) time complexity for access, insertion, and deletion using hash functions, but can degrade to O(n) in worst-case collision scenarios.\n- Data structures like Sets are crucial for tasks like removing duplicates and checking membership, often used as auxiliary structures in algorithms.","introduction":"This lecture provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental data structures and the critical concept of Big O notation, which are essential for technical coding interviews and computer science.

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

تعريف الوكيل الفردي ومكوناته الأساسية. تستكشف المحاضرة أهمية هذه الأنظمة في معالجة المهام المعقدة بكفاءة، بدءًا من العمليات الزراعية وحتى الاستجابة للكوارث. تبرز المحاضرة دور هذه الأنظمة في تحقيق التعاون والتوازي بين الكيانات الذكية لإنهاء المهام بفعالية وسرعة.\n\n### الملخص\nتبدأ المحاضرة بتعريف الوكيل (Agent) كأي كيان قادر على إدراك بيئته باستخدام أجهزة الاستشعار (Sensors) والتصرف فيها من خلال المشغلات (Actuators). يوضح المثال البشري أن الإنسان وكيل يمتلك حواس كأجهزة استشعار (مثل العين والأذن) وأعضاء كالمشغلات (مثل اليدين والقدمين والفم)، بينما يعتمد الروبوت على الكاميرات وأجهزة الاستشعار الأخرى للمدخلات والمحركات (Motors) للمخرجات. تُسلط المحاضرة الضوء على أنظمة الوكلاء المتعددين (Multi-Agent Systems) التي تسمح للوكلاء بالعمل بشكل متوازٍ لإنجاز المهام المعقدة بسرعة وفعالية، مثل زراعة الأراضي، إطفاء الحرائق، أو عمليات الاستكشاف والإنقاذ في حالات الكوارث، حيث يتعاون وكلاء مختلفون لأداء مهام متكاملة. هذه الأنظمة يمكن أن تكون برمجية (Software) أو مادية (Hardware) كالروبوتات.\n\nتنتقل المحاضرة إلى شرح وظيفة الوكيل وبرنامجه، حيث يتخذ الوكيل قرارات بناءً على تسلسل إدراكاته السابقة (Percept Sequence) ويهدف إلى تحقيق أقصى أداء ممكن. يُقدم مفهوم العقلانية

زيادة النتائج المتوقعة (Expected Outcome) وليست بالضرورة النتائج الفعلية (Actual Outcome) أو الوصول إلى حالة مثالية بسبب محدودية المعلومات. كما تُناقش فكرة الاستقلالية (Autonomy) للوكيل، وهي قدرته على التصرف بناءً على تجاربه الخاصة بدلاً من الالتزام التام بالتعليمات المبرمجة مسبقًا، مع التأكيد على أهمية تحقيق توازن بين البرمجة والاستقلالية.\n\nأخيرًا، تستعرض المحاضرة إطار عمل PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) كأداة لتحليل تصميم الوكلاء. يمثل كل حرف من PEAS جانبًا محددًا: مقياس الأداء (Performance Measurement)، البيئة (Environment)، المشغلات (Actuators)، وأجهزة الاستشعار (Sensors). يتم تطبيق هذا الإطار على ثلاثة أمثلة عملية: سائق التاكسي الآلي (Automated Taxi Driver)، روبوت جمع الأجزاء (Part-picking Robot)، والمدرس التفاعلي للغة الإنجليزية (Interactive English Tutor)، حيث يتم تفصيل مكونات PEAS لكل مثال لإظهار كيفية عمل الوكلاء في سياقات مختلفة، سواء كانت مادية أو برمجية.\n\n### أهم النقاط\n- الوكيل (Agent): كيان يدرك بيئته عبر أجهزة الاستشعار ويتصرف فيها عبر

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

(Multi-Agent Systems)، مبرزة أهميتها في حل المشكلات المعقدة بكفاءة وفعالية أكبر من النهج القائم على وكيل واحد. تشرح المحاضرة كيف تساهم هذه الأنظمة، سواء كانت مادية أو برمجية، في إنجاز المهام بشكل أسرع وأكثر فعالية من خلال المعالجة المتوازية والتعاون، مستشهدة بأمثلة من الزراعة، الإغاثة من الكوارث، وحل المشكلات العامة. وتوضح المحاضرة العناصر الأساسية للوكلاء وخصائصهم التي تمكنهم من التفاعل مع بيئاتهم واتخاذ قرارات عقلانية.\n\n### الملخص\nيُعرف الوكيل (Agent) بأنه أي كيان قادر على إدراك بيئته المحيطة عبر \"المستشعرات\" (Sensors) والتصرف فيها من خلال \"المشغلات\" (Actuators). يوضح المحاضر ذلك بمقارنة الوكلاء البشريين (مثل العيون كمستشعرات والأيدي كمشغلات) بالوكلاء الروبوتيين (مثل الكاميرات كمستشعرات والمحركات كمشغلات). يُحدد سلوك الوكيل بواسطة \"دالة الوكيل\" (Agent Function)، التي تُحوّل تسلسل الإدراكات السابقة (سجل الإدراكات) إلى إجراء مناسب. تُنفّذ هذه الدالة بواسطة \"برنامج الوكيل\" (Agent Program) الذي يعمل على بنية معمارية مادية أو برمجية محددة. يقدم مثال \"مُنظف المكنسة الكهربائية\" البسيط كيفية استخدام الإدراكات مثل الموقع ومستوى النظافة لتحديد الإجراءات (مثل التحرك يمينًا أو يسارًا أو الشفط)، وغالبًا ما يتم ذلك عبر جدول بحث يربط تسلسلات الإدراكات بالإجراءات. \n\nتتعمق المحاضرة في الخصائص الأساسية للوكلاء: \"العقلانية\" (Rationality) و\"الاستقلالية\" (Autonomy). تعني العقلانية أن الوكيل يختار الإجراء المتوقع أن يزيد من مقياس أدائه، مع الأخذ في الاعتبار معرفته المسبقة بالبيئة وتسلسل إدراكاته الحالي. ويشدد المحاضر على أن العقلانية تتعلق باتخاذ أفضل قرار بناءً على المعلومات المتاحة، وليس تحقيق \"الكمال\" (Perfection)، الذي يتطلب معرفة كاملة بجميع النتائج المحتملة. أما الاستقلالية، فتشير إلى قدرة الوكيل على التصرف بناءً على تجاربه المتراكمة بدلاً من الاعتماد الكلي على التعليمات المبرمجة مسبقًا. يشير المحاضر إلى أن الوكيل المثالي غالبًا ما يحقق توازنًا بين البدء ببعض المعرفة المحددة مسبقًا والتعلم المستمر والتكيف من خلال الخبرة.\n\nأخيرًا، تُقدم المحاضرة إطار عمل PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) كمنهج منظم لتحليل وتصميم الوكلاء. يحدد هذا الإطار بشكل منهجي معايير تقييم نجاح الوكيل (Performance)، والسياق الذي يعمل فيه (Environment)، والمخرجات التشغيلية (Actuators)، والمدخلات الحسية (Sensors). تُقدم أمثلة عملية لتعزيز الفهم، بما في ذلك \"سائق التاكسي الآلي\" (الذي يركز على الأمان، السرعة، القانونية، الراحة، وزيادة الأرباح)، و\"روبوت تجميع الأجزاء\" (الذي يركز على وضع الأجزاء بدقة)، و\"المدرس الخصوصي التفاعلي للغة الإنجليزية\" (الذي يهدف إلى زيادة درجات الطلاب في الاختبارات عبر شاشات العرض والمكبرات، ويتلقى المدخلات عبر لوحة المفاتيح والميكروفون). توضح هذه الأمثلة كيف تختلف مكونات PEAS بشكل كبير باختلاف تطبيقات الوكلاء.\n\n### أهم النقاط\n- الوكيل (Agent) هو أي كيان يدرك بيئته عبر المستشعرات (Sensors) ويتصرف فيها عبر المشغلات (Actuators).\n- الأنظمة متعددة الوكلاء (Multi-Agent Systems) تزيد الكفاءة والسرعة من خلال توزيع المهام والعمل بالتوازي.\n- يمكن أن تكون الوكلاء قائمة على الأجهزة المادية (مثل الروبوتات للإغاثة من الكوارث) أو البرامج (مثل معالجة وتنسيق المستندات).\n- المستشعرات هي مدخلات (مثل الكاميرات والميكروفونات)، والمشغلات هي مخرجات (مثل المحركات وشاشات العرض).\n- دالة الوكيل (Agent Function) تربط تسلسل الإدراكات (سجل الإدراكات) بالإجراءات الواجب اتخاذها.\n- العقلانية (Rationality) تعني أن الوكيل يتخذ إجراءات يتوقع أن تزيد من أدائه بناءً على المعرفة المتاحة والإدراكات، ولا تعني الكمال.\n- الاستقلالية (Autonomy) هي قدرة الوكيل على التصرف بناءً على خبراته الخاصة، وتحقيق توازن بين التعليمات المبرمجة مسبقًا والسلوك المتعلم.\n- إطار عمل PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) يستخدم لتحليل وتحديد مكونات أي نظام وكيل.\n- أمثلة تطبيقية لإطار PEAS تشمل سائق التاكسي

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب

في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها

الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما

الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه."}

اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

6:27:00 PM [express] POST /api/ai/summary 200 in 10497ms :: {"summary":"السلام عليكم ورحمه الله وبركاته النهارده ان شاء الله نتكلم عن الايجنت بيسد سيستم طبعا مبدئيا كده عشان اتكلم عن الايجنت بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه. بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده. لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه. بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا. ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه."}

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

المعقدة. يتم تعريف الوكيل ككيان يدرك بيئته عبر الحساسات ويتصرف فيها عبر المؤثرات، مما يمهد لفهم كيفية عمل الأنظمة متعددة الوكلاء (Multi-Agent Systems) التي تتيح إنجاز المهام بكفاءة وسرعة عبر العمل المتوازي.\n\n### الملخص\nيبدأ الشرح بتعريف الوكيل (Agent) كأي كيان يمكنه إدراك البيئة المحيطة به باستخدام حساسات (Sensors) والتصرف فيها من خلال مؤثرات (Actuators). على سبيل المثال، يمتلك الإنسان كوكيل حواس كالعين والأذن كمستشعرات، وأطراف مثل اليدين والقدمين كمؤثرات. بينما في الروبوتات، تكون الكاميرات وأجهزة الاستشعار بالأشعة تحت الحمراء هي الحساسات، والمحركات هي المؤثرات. تبرز أهمية الأنظمة متعددة الوكلاء (Multi-Agent Systems) في قدرتها على إنجاز المهام الصعبة والمعقدة بكفاءة عالية وسرعة فائقة من خلال توزيع العمل بين عدة وكلاء يعملون بالتوازي. وتشمل تطبيقاتها مجالات واسعة مثل الزراعة، الاستجابة للكوارث (كإنقاذ الأشخاص وإطفاء الحرائق)، وحتى الروبوتات السربية (Swarm Robotics). يمكن أن تكون هذه الوكلاء أنظمة مادية (Hardware Agents) مثل الروبوتات، أو برمجية (Software Agents) تؤدي مهام مثل التخطيط، الكتابة، والتنسيق ضمن تطبيقات الحاسوب.\n\nيتم التركيز على خاصيتين أساسيتين للوكلاء: العقلانية (Rationality) والاستقلالية (Autonomy). الوكيل العقلاني هو الذي يختار الإجراءات التي يتوقع أن تزيد من مقياس أدائه، وذلك بناءً على معرفة مسبقة ببيئته، وتسلسل الإدراكات التي تلقاها حتى اللحظة، والأفعال المتاحة له. هذه العقلانية لا تعني الوصول إلى الكمال (Perfection) لأن الوكيل قد لا يمتلك جميع المعلومات المتاحة، بل تعني تحسين الناتج المتوقع (Expected Outcome) قدر الإمكان. أما الاستقلالية، فتشير إلى قدرة الوكيل على التصرف بناءً على خبراته الخاصة التي اكتسبها، وليس فقط بالاعتماد على التعليمات المبرمجة مسبقًا من قبل المصمم. الوكلاء الفعالون يسعون لتحقيق توازن بين البرمجة الأولية والقدرة على التعلم والتكيف بشكل مستقل.\n\nلتحليل الأنظمة الوكيلة، يتم تقديم إطار عمل PEAS، الذي يرمز إلى (Performance Measure) مقياس الأداء، (Environment) البيئة، (Actuators) المؤثرات، و (Sensors) الحساسات. يتم توضيح هذا الإطار من خلال أمثلة عملية: 1) **سائق التاكسي الآلي:** أداؤه هو الوصول الآمن، السريع، القانوني، المريح وزيادة الأرباح، بيئته الطرق وحركة المرور والمشاة والركاب، مؤثراته هي عجلة القيادة والفرامل والإشارات، وحساساته هي الكاميرا والسونار وGPS. 2) **روبوت تجميع الأجزاء:** يقاس أداؤه بنسبة الأجزاء المجمعة والموضوعة بشكل صحيح، وبيئته حزام النقل والأجزاء والصناديق، ومؤثراته الذراع المفصلي واليد القابضة، وحساساته الكاميرا وحساسات زوايا المفاصل. 3) **مدرس اللغة الإنجليزية التفاعلي (وكيل برمجي):** يقاس أداؤه بزيادة درجات الطالب، وبيئته مجموعة الطلاب، ومؤثراته عرض الشاشة ومكبر الصوت، وحساساته لوحة المفاتيح والميكروفون. يساعد هذا الإطار في فهم كيفية تفاعل الوكلاء مع بيئاتهم لتحقيق أهدافهم المحددة.\n\n### أهم النقاط\n- تعريف الوكيل (Agent): كيان يدرك بيئته (حساسات) ويتصرف فيها (مؤثرات).\n- الأنظمة متعددة الوكلاء (Multi-Agent Systems): عمل متوازٍ لإنجاز مهام معقدة بكفاءة وسرعة.\n- تطبيقات الوكلاء المتنوعة: الزراعة، الاستجابة للكوارث، الروبوتات السربية، والوكلاء البرمجية.\n- الوكلاء يمكن أن تكون أنظمة مادية (Hardware Agents) أو برمجية (Software Agents).\n- الوظيفة الأساسية للوكيل (Agent Function): ربط تسلسل الإدراكات بالإجراءات المناسبة.\n- الوكيل العقلاني (Rational Agent): يختار الإجراءات التي تزيد من مقياس أدائه المتوقع بناءً على المعرفة المسبقة والإدراكات.\n- الفرق بين العقلانية والكمال (Rationality vs. Perfection): العقلانية تسعى لتعظيم الناتج المتوقع وليس الوصول للكمال المطلق.\n- الاستقلالية (Autonomy): قدرة الوكيل على التصرف بناءً على خبراته الخاصة المكتسبة وليس فقط التعليمات المبرمجة.\n- إطار عمل PEAS لتحليل الوكلاء: مقياس الأداء (Performance)، البيئة (Environment)، المؤثرات (Actuators)، الحساسات (Sensors).\n- أمثلة تطبيقية لإطار

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

6:47:41 PM [express] POST /api/ai/summary 200 in 10495ms :: {"summary":"السلام عليكم ورحمه الله وبركاته النهارده ان شاء الله نتكلم عن الايجنت بيسد سيستم طبعا مبدئيا كده عشان اتكلم عن الايجنت بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه. بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده. لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه. بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه. بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده. لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه. بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا. ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه."}

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي

سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه. بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده. لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه. بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا. ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه."}

بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

هذه الأنظمة في إنجاز المهام المعقدة بكفاءة وفعالية، مستعرضةً قدرتها على العمل بشكل متوازٍ والتعامل مع تحديات العالم الحقيقي. تستكشف المحاضرة مفاهيم أساسية مثل العقلانية والاستقلالية، بالإضافة إلى إطار عمل PEAS لتحليل سلوك الوكلاء وتصنيفهم.\n\n### الملخص\nتوضح المحاضرة أن الوكيل الذكي هو أي كيان يستطيع إدراك بيئته من خلال مستشعرات (Sensors) ويتصرف فيها عبر مؤثرات (Actuators). على سبيل المثال، يمتلك الإنسان مستشعرات كالعينين والأذنين ومؤثرات كاليدين والرجلين، بينما يمتلك الروبوت كاميرات وأجهزة استشعار بالأشعة تحت الحمراء ومحركات. وظيفة الوكيل هي ربط تسلسل الإدراكات التي يتلقاها بالإجراءات

لزيادة النتائج المتوقعة، وليس بالضرورة تحقيق أفضل نتيجة فعلية في كل مرة. أما الاستقلالية، فتشير إلى قدرة الوكيل على التصرف بناءً على خبراته وتجاربه الذاتية، بدلاً من الاعتماد الكلي على التعليمات

الايجنت بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

(Multi-Agent Systems)، مسلطاً الضوء على أهميتها في معالجة المهام المعقدة بكفاءة وفعالية. يشرح المحاضر كيف يمكن لهذه الأنظمة أن تحاكي التعاون البشري لإنجاز أهداف مشتركة بشكل أسرع وأكثر مرونة. لا تقتصر تطبيقات الوكلاء على الروبوتات والأجهزة، بل تمتد لتشمل الحلول البرمجية المتنوعة، مما يؤكد شمولية هذا المجال وأهميته المتزايدة.\n\n### الملخص\nيبدأ المحاضر بتعريف الوكيل (Agent) ككيان يتفاعل مع بيئته من خلال إدراكها عبر 'المستشعرات' (Sensors) واتخاذ إجراءات فيها عبر 'المشغلات' (Actuators). يتم تسليط الضوء على الفوائد الجمة لأنظمة الوكلاء المتعددين التي تسمح للوكلاء بالعمل بشكل متوازٍ وتعاوني لإنجاز المهام المعقدة، مما يقلل الوقت والجهد بشكل كبير. تُقدم أمثلة توضيحية متعددة تشمل مجالات مثل الزراعة (حيث يتعاون وكلاء متعددون لزراعة مساحات واسعة)، والاستجابة للكوارث (من خلال روبوتات الإنقاذ التي تتواصل مع وكلاء الإسعافات الأولية)، وإطفاء الحرائق، واستكشاف المناطق المجهولة، وحتى في تطبيقات البرمجيات حيث تعمل وحدات التخطيط والكتابة والتنسيق كوكلاء متعاونين.\n\nيُفصل العرض بنية الوكيل، موضحاً أن المستشعرات تمثل المدخلات التي تمكن الوكيل من إدراك بيئته (مثل الكاميرات والأشعة تحت الحمراء للروبوت، أو العينين والأذنين للإنسان)، بينما المشغلات هي المخرجات التي ينفذها الوكيل (مثل المحركات للروبوت، أو اليدين والساقين للإنسان). تُعرّف وظيفة الوكيل بأنها ربط تسلسل الإدراكات (Percept Sequence) بالإجراءات المناسبة التي يجب اتخاذها. يُقدم مفهوم 'العقلانية' (Rationality) للوكيل، حيث يُتوقع من الوكيل العقلاني أن يختار الإجراء الذي يزيد من قياس أدائه بناءً على معرفته المسبقة وبيئته وتسلسل إدراكاته السابقة، ويُفرق بين العقلانية والكمال، مؤكداً أن العقلانية تعني اتخاذ أفضل إجراء ممكن بالمعلومات المتاحة، وليس بالضرورة الوصول إلى نتيجة مثالية في ظل عدم توفر جميع المعلومات. كما يناقش مفهوم 'الاستقلالية' (Autonomy)، وهي قدرة الوكيل على التعلم والتصرف بناءً على تجاربه الخاصة بدلاً من الاعتماد الكلي على البرمجة المسبقة، مع التأكيد على أهمية تحقيق توازن بين الاستقلالية والبرمجة المسبقة.\n\nيُختتم العرض بتفصيل إطار عمل PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) كأداة تحليلية شاملة لأي نظام وكيل. يشمل هذا الإطار: قياس الأداء (Performance Measurement) لتحديد مدى نجاح الوكيل؛ البيئة (Environment) التي يعمل فيها الوكيل؛ المشغلات (Actuators) التي يستخدمها لتنفيذ الإجراءات؛ والمستشعرات (Sensors) التي يستخدمها لإدراك البيئة. يقدم المحاضر ثلاثة أمثلة رئيسية لتوضيح تطبيق إطار عمل PEAS: سائق التاكسي الآلي (الذي يُقاس أداؤه بالوصول الآمن والسريع والقانوني والمريح مع تعظيم الأرباح)، وروبوت تجميع الأجزاء (الذي يُقاس أداؤه بوضع الأجزاء في أماكنها الصحيحة)، والمدرس الخصوصي التفاعلي للغة الإنجليزية (الذي يُقاس أداؤه بتحسين درجات الطلاب).\n\n### أهم النقاط\n- الوكيل (Agent) هو أي كيان يدرك بيئته عبر مستشعرات وينفذ إجراءات عبر مشغلات.\n- أنظمة الوكلاء المتعددين تتيح التعاون والتوازي لإنجاز المهام المعقدة بفعالية، محاكيةً التعاون البشري.\n- تطبيقات الوكلاء تشمل الزراعة، الإنقاذ، إطفاء الحرائق، الاستكشاف، وتطبيقات البرمجيات.\n- يتفاعل الوكيل مع بيئته من خلال المستشعرات (كمدخلات) والمشغلات (كمخرجات).\n- وظيفة الوكيل تربط تسلسل الإدراكات (Percept Sequence) بالإجراءات المناسبة.\n- العقلانية (Rationality) تتطلب من الوكيل اختيار الإجراء الذي يزيد من أدائه المتوقع بناءً على المعرفة المسبقة والإدراكات السابقة.\n- العقلانية تختلف عن الكمال (Perfection)؛ فهي تعني اتخاذ أفضل قرار بالمعلومات المتاحة، وليس بالضرورة الوصول إلى نتيجة مثالية في ظل عدم توفر جميع المعلومات.\n- الاستقلالية (Autonomy) هي قدرة الوكيل على التعلم والتصرف بناءً على تجاربه الخاصة، وليس فقط القواعد المبرمجة مسبقاً.\n- إطار عمل PEAS يحلل الوكلاء بناءً على أربع مكونات رئيسية: الأداء (Performance)، البيئة (Environment)، المشغلات (Actuators)، والمستشعرات (Sensors).\n- أمثلة تطبيقية لإطار PEAS تشمل

الايجنت بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

الايجنت بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

الإسعافات)، ومكافحة الحرائق، واستكشاف البيئات. لا تقتصر الوكلاء على المكونات المادية (الروبوتات)، بل يمكن أن تكون وكلاء برمجية (Software Agents) تؤدي مهام مثل التخطيط أو الكتابة أو التنسيق الاحترافي

الايجنت بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه. بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده. لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه. بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا. ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه."}

السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

11:58:47 PM [express] POST /api/ai/summary 200 in 10530ms :: {"summary":"السلام عليكم ورحمه الله وبركاته النهارده ان شاء الله نتكلم عن الايجنت بيسد سيستم طبعا مبدئيا كده عشان اتكلم عن الايجنت بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه. بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده. لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه. بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا. ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه."}

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا

عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه. بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده. لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه. بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا. ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه."}

اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه. بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده. لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه. بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا. ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه."}

عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

6:00:13 AM [express] POST /api/ai/summary 200 in 21926ms :: {"summary":"### المقدمة\nيتناول هذا المحاضرة أنظمة الوكلاء (Agent-Based Systems) والأنظمة متعددة الوكلاء (Multi-Agent Systems)، والتي تعد أساسًا في التعامل مع المهام المعقدة والمتوزعة. تُبرز أهمية هذه الأنظمة في قدرتها على تنفيذ المهام بكفاءة وسرعة، مثل الزراعة المتوازية أو الاستجابة للكوارث، حيث تعمل الوكلاء معًا لتحقيق هدف مشترك. يمكن للوكلاء أن يكونوا كيانات مادية (مثل الروبوتات) أو برمجية، وتهدف هذه الأنظمة إلى تحقيق أهداف معينة من خلال التفاعل الذكي مع البيئة المحيطة.\n\n### الملخص\nالوكيل هو أي كيان قادر على إدراك بيئته من خلال أجهزة استشعار (Sensors) والتصرف فيها عبر مشغلات (Actuators). فعلى سبيل المثال، يمتلك الإنسان أجهزة استشعار كالعين والأذن والجلد، ومشغلات كاليدين والقدمين والفم. بينما تعتمد الروبوتات على الكاميرات وأجهزة الأشعة تحت الحمراء والسونار كمستشعرات، والمحركات وعجلات القيادة والمكابح كمشغلات. وظيفة الوكيل (Agent Function) هي خريطة تحول تسلسل الإدراك (Percept Sequence) إلى إجراءات محددة، ويتم تنفيذ هذه الوظيفة بواسطة برنامج الوكيل على بنية معمارية مادية أو برمجية. تم توضيح ذلك من خلال مثال بسيط لمكنسة كهربائية آلية، حيث تستجيب لحالتها وموقعها (نظيف/متسخ، في الغرفة A/B) لاتخاذ إجراءات مثل التنظيف أو الانتقال.  \n\nتُعد \"العقلانية\" (Rationality) خاصية أساسية للوكلاء، حيث يختار الوكيل إجراءً يتوقع أن يزيد من مقياس أدائه، بناءً على معرفته المسبقة بالبيئة وتسلسل إدراكاته. من المهم التمييز بين العقلانية والكمال (Perfection)، فالوكيل العقلاني يسعى لتعظيم النتائج المتوقعة بناءً على المعلومات المتاحة لديه، وليس بالضرورة الوصول إلى نتيجة مثالية تتطلب معرفة كاملة بكل المتغيرات الممكنة. أما \"الاستقلالية\" (Autonomy)، فهي قدرة الوكيل على التصرف بناءً على خبرته الخاصة بدلاً من الاعتماد الكلي على التعليمات المسبقة من المصمم، ويفضل أن يكون للوكيل درجة معينة من الاستقلالية لتمكينه من التعلم والتكيف مع الظروف المتغيرة. لتوصيف وتحليل الوكلاء بشكل منهجي، يُستخدم إطار عمل PEAS الذي يرمز إلى Performance Measure (مقياس الأداء)، Environment (البيئة)، Actuators (المشغلات)، وSensors (المستشعرات). وقد تم تطبيق هذا الإطار على أمثلة عملية مثل سائق التاكسي الآلي وروبوت تجميع الأجزاء والمدرس التفاعلي للغة الإنجليزية، لتوضيح كيفية تحديد هذه المكونات لكل نظام.\n\n### أهم النقاط\n- الوكيل (Agent): كيان يدرك بيئته عبر مستشعرات ويتصرف فيها عبر مشغلات.\n- وظيفة الوكيل (Agent Function): تحول تسلسل الإدراك (Percept Sequence) إلى إجراءات (Actions).\n- برنامج الوكيل (Agent Program): تنفيذ لوظيفة

في التعامل مع المهام المعقدة والمتوزعة. تُبرز أهمية هذه الأنظمة في قدرتها على تنفيذ المهام بكفاءة وسرعة، مثل الزراعة المتوازية أو الاستجابة للكوارث، حيث تعمل الوكلاء معًا لتحقيق هدف مشترك. يمكن للوكلاء أن يكونوا كيانات مادية (مثل الروبوتات) أو برمجية، وتهدف هذه الأنظمة إلى تحقيق أهداف معينة من خلال التفاعل الذكي مع البيئة المحيطة.","mainSummary":"الوكيل هو أي كيان قادر على إدراك بيئته من خلال أجهزة استشعار (Sensors) والتصرف فيها عبر مشغلات (Actuators). فعلى سبيل المثال، يمتلك الإنسان أجهزة استشعار كالعين والأذن والجلد، ومشغلات كاليدين والقدمين والفم. بينما تعتمد الروبوتات على الكاميرات وأجهزة الأشعة تحت الحمراء والسونار كمستشعرات، والمحركات وعجلات القيادة والمكابح كمشغلات. وظيفة الوكيل (Agent Function) هي خريطة تحول تسلسل الإدراك (Percept Sequence) إلى إجراءات محددة، ويتم تنفيذ هذه الوظيفة بواسطة برنامج الوكيل على بنية معمارية مادية أو برمجية. تم توضيح ذلك من خلال مثال بسيط لمكنسة كهربائية آلية، حيث تستجيب لحالتها وموقعها (نظيف/متسخ، في الغرفة A/B) لاتخاذ إجراءات مثل التنظيف أو الانتقال.  \n\nتُعد \"العقلانية\" (Rationality) خاصية أساسية للوكلاء، حيث يختار الوكيل إجراءً يتوقع أن يزيد من مقياس أدائه، بناءً على معرفته المسبقة بالبيئة وتسلسل إدراكاته. من المهم التمييز بين العقلانية والكمال (Perfection)، فالوكيل العقلاني يسعى لتعظيم النتائج المتوقعة بناءً على المعلومات المتاحة لديه، وليس بالضرورة الوصول إلى نتيجة مثالية تتطلب معرفة كاملة بكل المتغيرات الممكنة. أما \"الاستقلالية\" (Autonomy)، فهي قدرة الوكيل على التصرف بناءً على خبرته الخاصة بدلاً من الاعتماد الكلي على التعليمات المسبقة من المصمم، ويفضل أن يكون للوكيل درجة معينة من الاستقلالية لتمكينه من التعلم والتكيف مع الظروف المتغيرة. لتوصيف وتحليل الوكلاء بشكل منهجي، يُستخدم إطار عمل PEAS الذي يرمز إلى Performance Measure (مقياس الأداء)، Environment (البيئة)، Actuators (المشغلات)، وSensors (المستشعرات). وقد تم تطبيق هذا الإطار على أمثلة عملية مثل سائق التاكسي الآلي وروبوت تجميع الأجزاء والمدرس التفاعلي للغة الإنجليزية، لتوضيح كيفية تحديد هذه المكونات لكل نظام.","keypoints":["الوكيل (Agent): كيان يدرك بيئته عبر مستشعرات ويتصرف فيها عبر مشغلات.","وظيفة الوكيل (Agent Function): تحول تسلسل الإدراك (Percept Sequence) إلى إجراءات (Actions).","برنامج الوكيل

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

(Multi-Agent Systems). تركز على تعريف الوكيل، مكوناته الأساسية، وكيف يتفاعل مع بيئته. يتم تسليط الضوء على أهمية هذه الأنظمة في حل المشكلات المعقدة وتطبيقاتها المتنوعة في مجالات مثل الزراعة، الاستجابة للكوارث، والروبوتات الذكية، بالإضافة إلى الأنظمة البرمجية.\n\n### الملخص\nيبدأ المحاضر بتعريف الوكيل (Agent) على أنه كيان يمكنه إدراك بيئته باستخدام أجهزة الاستشعار (Sensors) والتصرف فيها من خلال المشغلات (Actuators). يوضح أن الوكيل البشري يدرك عبر الحواس (مثل العين والأذن) ويتصرف عبر أعضاء الحركة (مثل اليدين والرجلين)، بينما الوكيل الروبوتي يستخدم الكاميرات وأجهزة الاستشعار بالأشعة تحت الحمراء كمدخلات، والمحركات (Motors) كمخرجات. تعمل وظيفة الوكيل على أساس \"تسلسل الإدراك\" (Percept Sequence) الذي يمثل تاريخ الإدراكات لاتخاذ الإجراءات المناسبة، وتستند هذه الوظيفة إلى بنية معمارية مادية (للأجهزة) وبرمجية (للسوفت وير).\n\nتتناول المحاضرة مفهوم \"العقلانية\" (Rationality) للوكيل، حيث يُعرف الوكيل العقلاني بأنه الكيان الذي يختار الإجراء الذي يتوقع أن يزيد من مقياس أدائه، بناءً على معرفته المسبقة بالبيئة، والإجراءات الممكنة، وتاريخ الإدراك الخاص به. يؤكد المحاضر أن العقلانية لا تعني الكمال (Perfection)؛ فالوكيل العقلاني يسعى لتعظيم النتيجة المتوقعة (Expected Outcome) وليس بالضرورة النتيجة الفعلية (Actual Outcome)، نظرًا لعدم توفر جميع المعلومات دائمًا. كما يناقش مفهوم \"الاستقلالية\" (Autonomy)، وهي قدرة الوكيل على التعلم والتصرف بناءً على خبراته الخاصة بدلاً من الاعتماد الكلي على التعليمات المبرمجة مسبقًا من المصمم، مشيرًا إلى أن أفضل نهج هو تحقيق توازن بين التوجيه الأولي والقدرة على اكتساب الخبرة والاستقلالية مع مرور الوقت.\n\nيقدم المحاضر إطار عمل PEAS (Performance Measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) كأداة لتحليل وتحديد خصائص الوكيل. يشرح كل عنصر من عناصر PEAS من خلال ثلاثة أمثلة عملية: سائق سيارة الأجرة الآلي، وروبوت جمع الأجزاء، ومدرس اللغة الإنجليزية التفاعلي. فمثلاً، بالنسبة لسائق سيارة الأجرة الآلي، يشمل مقياس الأداء (P) الأمان والسرعة والالتزام بالقوانين والراحة وزيادة الربح؛ والبيئة (E) الطرق والمرور والمشاة والعملاء؛ والمشغلات (A) عجلة القيادة والمكابح والإشارات؛ والمستشعرات (S) الكاميرات والسونار ونظام تحديد المواقع العالمي (GPS).\n\n### أهم النقاط\n- الوكيل (Agent): كيان يدرك بيئته (Sensors) ويتصرف فيها (Actuators).\n- تطبيقات الأنظمة المعتمدة على الوكلاء: الزراعة، الاستجابة للكوارث، الروبوتات الاستكشافية، وأنظمة البرمجيات مثل برامج التحرير.\n- وظيفة الوكيل: تحدد بناءً على تسلسل الإدراك (Percept Sequence) لاتخاذ الإجراءات.\n- العقلانية (Rationality): اختيار الإجراء الأمثل لتعظيم مقياس الأداء بناءً على المعرفة المسبقة وتاريخ الإدراك.\n- العقلانية لا تعني الكمال: تهدف لتعظيم النتيجة المتوقعة وليست النتيجة

8:26:30 PM [express] POST /api/youtube/transcript 200 in 1757ms :: {"transcript":"السلام عليكم ورحمه الله وبركاته النهارده ان شاء الله نتكلم عن الايجنت بيسد سيستم طبعا مبدئيا كده عشان اتكلم عن الايجنت بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

تحت الحمراء كمدخلات، والمحركات كمخرجات للتصرف. الوظيفة الأساسية للوكيل هي تحويل تسلسل الإدراكات التاريخية إلى إجراءات محددة، ويتم تنفيذ هذه الوظيفة بواسطة برنامج الوكيل الذي يعمل على بنية معمارية فيزيائية (كجهاز روبوت) أو برمجية (كتطبيق سوفت وير). تم توضيح ذلك بمثال المكنسة الكهربائية الآلية التي تدرك موقعها ونظافة المكان لتحديد ما إذا كانت ستقوم بالشفط أو الانتقال يمينًا أو يسارًا.\n\nتركز

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم

في مجال الذكاء الاصطناعي. تُبرز المحاضرة أهمية هذه الأنظمة في معالجة المهام المعقدة بكفاءة عالية وسرعة فائقة من خلال توزيع العمل والتعاون المتوازي بين الوكلاء، مما يفتح آفاقاً واسعة للتطبيقات العملية في مختلف المجالات.\n\n### الملخص\nتبدأ المحاضرة بتعريف الوكيل (Agent) على أنه كيان يدرك بيئته من خلال أجهزة استشعار (Sensors) ويتخذ إجراءات عليها عبر مشغلات (Actuators). يمكن أن يكون الوكيل إما كائناً مادياً مثل الروبوت (الذي يستخدم الكاميرات والسونار كـ Sensors والمحركات كـ Actuators) أو برنامجاً (Software Agent). يتم التأكيد على أن الأنظمة متعددة الوكلاء تعزز الكفاءة بشكل كبير من خلال تنفيذ المهام بشكل متوازي، كما هو الحال في الزراعة أو عمليات الإنقاذ بعد الكوارث أو أنظمة مكافحة الحرائق، حيث يتعاون عدة وكلاء لإنجاز مهمة أسرع وأكثر فعالية.\n\nتُناقش المحاضرة بعد ذلك مفهوم \"العقلانية\" (Rationality)، حيث يُتوقع من الوكيل العقلاني أن يختار الإجراءات التي تزيد من مقياس أدائه بناءً على معرفته المسبقة بالبيئة، وتاريخ الإدراك (Percept Sequence History)، والإجراءات المتاحة. يتم التمييز بين العقلانية والكمال (Perfection)، حيث تهدف العقلانية إلى زيادة النتائج المتوقعة وليست النتائج الفعلية المطلقة، لأن الوكيل نادراً ما يمتلك معلومات كاملة عن بيئته. كما تُقدم المحاضرة مفهوم \"الاستقلالية\" (Autonomy) للوكيل، وهي قدرته على التصرف بناءً على تجاربه الخاصة بدلاً من الاعتماد الكلي على التعليمات المبرمجة مسبقاً، مع التأكيد على أهمية تحقيق توازن بين الاستقلالية الكاملة والبرمجة المسبقة لتحقيق أفضل أداء.\n\nتختتم المحاضرة بتقديم إطار عمل \"PEAS\" (Performance Measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) لتحليل وتصميم الوكلاء، موضحةً أن كل حرف يمثل عنصراً حيوياً في وصف نظام الوكيل. تم تطبيق هذا الإطار على ثلاثة أمثلة عملية: سائق التاكسي الآلي (حيث يشمل الأداء القيادة الآمنة والسريعة والربحية، والبيئة هي الطرق والمشاة والعملاء، والمشغلات هي عجلة القيادة والمكابح، وأجهزة الاستشعار هي الكاميرات ونظام تحديد المواقع)، وروبوت التقاط الأجزاء (حيث يشمل الأداء تجميع الأجزاء بشكل صحيح، والبيئة هي حزام النقل والحاويات، والمشغلات هي الذراع والمفاصل، وأجهزة الاستشعار هي الكاميرات)، والمدرس الخصوصي التفاعلي للغة الإنجليزية (كوكيل برمجي، حيث يشمل الأداء تحسين درجات الطلاب، والبيئة هي الطلاب، والمشغلات هي الشاشة والسماعات، وأجهزة الاستشعار هي لوحة المفاتيح والميكروفون).\n\n### أهم النقاط\n- الوكيل (Agent) هو أي كيان يدرك بيئته من خلال أجهزة استشعار ويتخذ إجراءات عليها عبر مشغلات.\n- أنظمة الوكلاء المتعددة (Multi-Agent Systems) تزيد من كفاءة إنجاز المهام وتعالج المشاكل المعقدة عبر التعاون المتوازي.\n- يمكن أن تكون الوكلاء برمجيات (Software Agents) أو أجهزة مادية (Hardware Agents) مثل الروبوتات.\n- تعتمد وظيفة الوكيل على تاريخ الإدراك (Percept Sequence History) لاتخاذ الإجراءات المناسبة.\n- مفهوم \"العقلانية\" (Rationality) يعني اختيار الإجراءات التي تزيد من الأداء المتوقع للوكيل، وليس تحقيق الكمال المطلق.\n- \"الاستقلالية\" (Autonomy) هي قدرة الوكيل على التعلم والتصرف بناءً على تجاربه الخاصة، مع ضرورة تحقيق توازن في مستوى الاستقلالية.\n- إطار عمل PEAS (Performance Measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) ضروري لتحليل وتصميم الوكلاء بفعالية.\n- تم تطبيق إطار PEAS على أمثلة عملية مثل سائق التاكسي الآلي، وروبوت التقاط الأجزاء، والمدرس الخصوصي التفاعلي.","introduction":"تتناول هذه المحاضرة الشاملة أنظمة الوكلاء (Agents) وأنظمة

موضحةً أن كل حرف يمثل عنصراً حيوياً في وصف نظام الوكيل. تم تطبيق هذا الإطار على ثلاثة أمثلة عملية: سائق التاكسي الآلي (حيث يشمل الأداء القيادة الآمنة والسريعة والربحية، والبيئة هي الطرق والمشاة والعملاء، والمشغلات هي عجلة القيادة والمكابح، وأجهزة الاستشعار هي الكاميرات ونظام تحديد المواقع)، وروبوت التقاط الأجزاء (حيث يشمل الأداء تجميع الأجزاء بشكل صحيح، والبيئة هي حزام النقل والحاويات، والمشغلات هي الذراع والمفاصل، وأجهزة الاستشعار هي الكاميرات)، والمدرس الخصوصي التفاعلي للغة الإنجليزية (كوكيل برمجي، حيث يشمل الأداء تحسين درجات الطلاب، والبيئة هي الطلاب، والمشغلات هي الشاشة والسماعات، وأجهزة الاستشعار هي لوحة المفاتيح والميكروفون).","keypoints":["الوكيل (Agent) هو أي كيان يدرك بيئته من خلال أجهزة استشعار ويتخذ إجراءات عليها عبر مشغلات.","أنظمة الوكلاء المتعددة

بيزد سيستمز او المالتي ايجنت عموما لازم نعرف يعني ايه ايجنت هنتكلم عن ايه وحاجات كتير جدا خاصه بالايجنت عموما طيب هو المالتي ايجنت سيستمز دي يعني بتفيدني في ايه او زي ايه حضرتك مثلا لو انت عندك اي حاجه مثلا زراعيه زي ارض زراعيه مطلوب منك مثلا ان انت تزرعها لو انت بتزرع زرعها لوحدك احنا هنتكلم اهو ولا ولا لو انت معاك 10 12 بيزرعوها معاك اكيد لو معاك عدد ده احسن وبتخلص بسرعه لان كل واحد فيكم مثلا بيشتغل بشكل برايل كده فيبدا يزرع جزء و حضرتك بتزرع جزء وغيرك بيزرع جزء وهكذا فبالتالي المهمه بتخلص مثلا ل حضرتك كنت هتخلصها في 12 ساعه مع البني ادمين اللي معاك دول ممكن تخلصها في ساعه واحده فقط هي بنفس الفكره ان انت بتقدر تعمل مثلا ايجنت ممكن ايجنت دي تشتغل مع بعض برايل ايجنتس يعني مع بعض في نفس الوقت كل واحد فيهم بياخد تاسك معينه زي كده مثلا زي الارض سي هيجمعوا المحصول ده او هيرجعوا المحصول ده بعد ما ما خلاص جمعه هيزرعه ثاني برده كل واحد فيهم بيمشي في لاين مثلا ويبدا يزرع اللاين ده كمان لو عندي اي ديزاستر يعني اي مش مصيبه زي مثلا حصل زلزله قدر الله والناس دلوقتي موجوده تحت ال تحت الارض طيب انا هعمل ايه ممكن اجيب روبتس يجي بقى يكتشف مثلا ان في ناس هنا وبني ادم عايش ا يطلعه ويتصل مثلا يتواصل بايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه دي دورها انها بتقدم اسعافات اوليه او بتيجي بسرعه ا للمكان ده عشان تنقذ البني ادم اللي انقذوه من تحت الارض ده و وهكذا بقى يعني ايجنت بتسلم ايجنت كده برده لو عندي مثلا حريق فطب جزء برده بيمشوا مثلا كل واحد بيطفي جزء في الحريق لو هم معتمدين على حاجه واحده بس ا ده ما بيخلصش التسك وممكن الحريق يرجع ثاني يتجدد من اول وجديد ده في الدرونز بقى سواء في ان حضرتك تعمل مثلا سوار سوارم روبوتكس كتير شغالين امبارال ده كل ده موجود يعني مثلا برده عندنا مثال ان انا مثلا لو عندي ا حد او روبوت بيكتشف المكان او بيعمل اكسبلورين للاريا اللي حواليه وبعدين بعدين اكتشف عائق ما في مكان هو مش عارف يكتشفه فبيعمل ايه؟ بيبعت لايجنت ثانيه الايجنت الثانيه يقول لها انا في اوبستيكل قدامي او في عوائق قدامي فتروح هي تبدا انها تحرك العائق من قدامه وترجع تبعت لهاني تقول له انا العائق تم تحريكه يرجع تاني لنفس البوزيشن ويبدا يدخل يكتشف باقي الااريا اللي ما كانش مكتشفاه قبل كده فدي حاجات كلها موجوده عندنا وتطبيقات طبعا يعني ممتازه طب هل هل الايجنت دي بتكون بس هارد وير وروبتكس وكده؟ لا ممكن تكون سوفت وير يعني مثلا ممكن حضرتك يكون عندك مالتي ايجنت يكون مثلا عندك ايجنت بتعمل بلانينج بتفكر في حاجه معينه بتخطط لحاجه معينه واحداني بيبدا يكتب حاجه معينه بيعمل بيبقى رايتر مثلا واحد ثالث بيبدا يعمل بياخد الكلام اللي اتكتب ده وينسقه في شكل احترافي مثلا او يطلع الفاينال برودكت او الشكل العام في الاخر بتاع السوفت السوفت وير يكون شكله كويس ازاي بعد ما خت خلاص الكتابه مكتوبه كده متلخبطه بيبتدي يعمل لها تنسيق وتنظيم ويعمل البولد بولد الاتاليك ايتالك الاندرلاين اندرلاين بحيث ان هو يطلع لليوزر في شكل كويس جدا فدي كلها حاجات موجوده يعني اذا سوفت وير ممكن هناخد برده مثال عليه ممكن هارد وير ممكن روبتكس اني واي كل دي حاجات موجوده عندنا الايجنتس فمن هنا بقى لابد كان من تعريف ايه اللي احنا الاول هناخده وبعدين هنقول تعريف يبقى الايجنتس والانفايرونتس اللي حوالينا هنعرفها ازاي في عندي حاجه اسمها راشونالتي في عندي حاجه اسمها بي اي اس اللي هو برفورمنس ميجرمنت انفايرنت اكتورز وكمان السنسورز عندي الانفايرونت تايبس كمان الايجنت تايبس ايه طب انا لو اتكلمت مبدئيا كده عن الايجنتس هي ايه الايجنت ده لو قلت ايجنت ده اي حاجه اقدر ان انا اشوفها ا زي مثلا ان انا ادرك ال البيئه اللي حواليا عن طريق ايه ما هو الروبوت ده يعني مش بيشوف طبعا ولا بيحس ولا اي حاجه فلازم اكون مدياه شويه سنسورز عشان يقدر ان هو يعني ياخد اكشن تجاه البيئه دي عن طريق الاكتويترز يبقى انا الكلام ده ازاي بقى انا عندي سنسورز من الاخر كده سنسورز داخله عندي انا كايجنت وانا ببدا ان انا ابني معتقداتي او ان انا اعمل تصور كامل للمشكله اللي انا فيها وابتدي اخد اكشن الاكشن ده بيتم عن طريق الاكتويتر تمام طيب يعني انت عندك نفسك هيومان ايجنت يعني الانسان ده لو احنا اعتبرناه ايجنت فعنده برض سنسورز وعنده اكتويتورز السنسورز دي تعتبر دخل الاكتويتورز دي تعتبر خارج طب انا ازاي باخد خد الحاجه يعني مثلا حضرتك وانت واقف مثلا ا انا عايزه اطبخ مثلا فعايزه احط الطماطم على الطماطم مثلا عصرها عايزه احطها على النار فانا ابتدي ان انا ادور على الطماطم حواليا تمام بشوفها ازاي يبقى انا بشوفها عن طريق عينيا يبقى عن طريق الايه عن طريق الايس بتاعتي طيب انا مثلا حد سالني سؤال يبقى انا المفروض هقول له اجابه طب سالني سؤال انا اخدت استقبلت ازاي السؤال ده استقبلته مش بعينيا اكيد لا استقبلته عن طريق ودني الايرز بتاعتي وايا كان بقى العضو العضو اللي انا باخد منه حاجه باخد منه اي عضو اي اورجان في جسمي انا باخد منه دخل كسنسور عندي زي مثلا امسك حاجه سخنه او كوبايه سخنه ده اسمه ايه؟ بمسك حاجه معينه الاوتبوت اللي بيطلع مني بناء على الكلام ده ان انا مثلا رحت جبت الطماطم حطيتها في الحله فانا جبت الطماطم دي معناه ان انا رحت استخدمت الهاندز بتاعتي الاكتويتورز بتاعتي ومشيت استخدمت الليجز بتاعتي وابتديت ان انا احطها في الايه في الاكل طيب انا لو عايزه ارد على الراجل اللي سالني السؤال يبقى انا هستخدم الماوس يبقى ده خارج اهو خارج بيطلع اوتبوت تمام او اي حاجات ثانيه برده في الجسم ممكن برده تطلع اوتبوت تمام الروبوت بقى ما عندوش الكلام ده لا عنده ايد ولا ودن ولا رجل ولا الكلام ده بس عنده سنسورز فالسنسورز دي ليها برض حاجات بتبقى انبوت من يعني استقبل من بره يعني لو عايزه احاكي العينين بتاعه الانسان هقول ان هو الروبوت ده عنده ايه عنده كاميرا صح ولا لا؟ ا عنده برده ا انفراريد يقدر يستقبل المسافات مثلا اقول ايه انفراريد مثلا في على مسافه معينه ممكن ياخد مثلا اكشن معين بناء على الانبوت اللي دخل له ده صح ان مثلا في فلان عدى من الحته دي طيب لا مثلا لا لو عدى من الحته دي يبقى المفروض هو ياخد اكشن يعمل انذار او يشغل مثلا حاجه معينه او يبعت نوتيفيكيشن او اني واي طب عندي الاكتويتورز زي ايه عندي مثلا الموتور ده مثال صريح على الاكتويتورز لان هو هو يعني بيمشي بناء على الموتور اللي موجود معاه فبيشغله فبيمشي يبقى انا دلوقتي عندي الايجنت زي ما احنا قلنا انا عندي سنسورز موجوده في الايجنت وبيطلع رد الفعل بتاعه او الفعل بتاعه عن طريق الاكتويتورز ده طبعا بناء على ايه ان هو تفاعل مع البيئه او الانفايرمنت اللي معاه عن طريق بعض البيرسبتس اللي موجود عنده وبدا ان هو يطلع اكشنز معينه طيب الايجنت فانكشن يبقى انا مجموعه عندي من البيرسبت هيستورز واقدر بناء عليها اخد اكشن معين يبقى انا دلوقتي هو بيادي وظيفته على اساس البيرسبت هيستورز اللي موجوده عنده ويطلع لي اكشن معين طب الايجنت بروجرام بيشتغل على فيزيكال اركتكتشر عشان يشغل ايه او يطلع الفانكشن دي يعني ايه اركيتكتشر يعني حضرتك الروبوت ده مش انت المفروض عامل اركتكتشر معين للروبوت ده وسوفت وير ما هو انت انا لو خليني اقول لك لو الكمبيوتر اللي عندك الكمبيوتر اللي عندك ده بيفهم يعني حته حديد اهو رحت اشتريته من اغلى وافخم الانواع ماشي وبعدين عنده ماذ بورد وعنده ا عنده مثلا بروسيسور وعنده رامات وعنده روم وعنده كل حاجه جميله بس في الاخر هو حديده ما عندوش برنامج بيشغل ما فيش سوفت وير تمام فانت عندك الروبوت عموما او الايجنت عموما بتشتغل على اركتكتشر معين حتى لو هو سوفت وير ما هو بيشتغل على الكمبيوتر يعني لو انا قلت اعمل ايجنت سوفت وير السوفت وير ده برض محتاج اركتكتشر اللي هو محتاج ايه؟ محتاج ان هو يشتغل على كمبيوتر معين عندنا مثلا مثال بسيط خالص بتاع الفاكيوم كلينر ده ده ديمو بسيط على الشغل ده ممكن برده تبصوا عليه ديمو على الموقع الرسمي الكتاب اللي انا شغاله منه طبعا الفاكيوم كلينر ده معناها اللي هي المكنسه اللي هي بتشفط الغبار او الحاجات الحجات اللي موجوده عندنا انا مدياها ايه؟ انا المفروض بديها بخليها تدرك حاجه معينه يعني مثلا انا بقول انا هديها بيرسبتس معينه انها دلوقتي بتقدر تعمل ايه؟ انها مثلا اللوكيشن بتاعها اللوكيشن بتاعها انت في اي ولا بي يعني انت هنا او هنا كمان عندي الكونتنتس بتاعتي يعني انت عندك ديرتي ولا كلي وبناء على عليها الاكشن اللي هيحصل انها تمشي رايت ليفت اني واي او هتعمل سك او انت شفت الغبار او انها تعمل نو اوبريشن لو ايه امتى تعملنا اوبريشن لو المكانين نضافوا فالايجنتس فانكشن لوك لوك اب تيبل لوك اب تيبل بناء على التيبل اللي موجود عندي ده هي المفروض انها بتبدا تفكر فعندي بيرسبت سيكوانس يعني السيكونس بتاع الادراك بتاعها يعني ايه يعني هي هتاخد اكشن بناء على البيرسبت بتاعها او الادراك بتاعها انت فين يا حبيبتي انا في ايه طيب ايه لو كلين خلاص يبقى انا هروح بيه اشوف الدنيا فيها ايه زي مثلا انا في اوضه انا عامله لها ان المساحه اللي هي تتحرك فيها اوضتين ماشي فهي في الاوضه الاولانيه هي نضيفه طب تروح تشوف بيه فيبقى هي هتتحرك ايه يمين طب ايه وديرتي لا يبقى انا هنضف المكان اللي انا واقفه فيه ده يبقى سك طب بي وكلين يبقى معناها ان هي نضيفه تروح شمال هي في بي وكلين تروح ليفت عشان تشوف المكان في ايه نضيف ولا لا طب بي وديرتي لو هنا في بي وبي وديرتي يبقى المفروض انها تيه هتعمل سك او هتايه هتشفط البخار طب هي كمان ممكن يكون عندها هيستوري من الكلام يعني انا دلوقتي عندي اي وكلين قديم وانا ستيل في اي وكلين برده يبقى المفروض همشي ازاي انا في اي وكلين وقبل كده وايه وكلين ستيل فيها ممكن امشي يمين طب ايه وكلين وايه وديرتي لا انا كانت اللي قبل كده ايه وكلين ودلوقتي انها مش نضيفه فانا سك يبقى انا هاه هنظف الغبار اللي موجود عندي طب عندنا حاجه اسمها بقى راشوناليتي يعني العقلانيه هيا يوز يور برين احنا دايما نقوللك يستخدم دماغك شويه طب هل الصح ايه هل الصح دلوقتي ان انا دلوقتي اخلي الايجنت بتاعتي تتميز بعقلانيه تامه اديها كل الصلاحيات وخليها تفكر بمزاجها ولا لا اقول احجمها واخليها بري ترند بقى انا يعني او اخليها اديها حاجات معينه ان هي بري بروجرام يعني انت متبرمجه بشكل معين كذا ولا سيب ولا سيبها في النص طب ما نفهم الاول الراشوناليتي الاول لازم الاول خالص ان انا يكون عندي ا اقدر اقيس البرفورمنس بشكل ناجح يعني انا يعني هي قادره دلوقتي عملت الشغلانه قادره تقيس ادائها في الشغلانه اللي عملتها دي بشكل كويس ولازم يكون عندها بيريور نولدج عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها معرفه مسبقه عن الانفايرمنت اللي حواليها وتعرف كمان ايه الاكشنز اللي المفروض انا اعملها يعني انت تديني بيرور نولدج وتقول لي انفايرمنت دي نضيفه ولا مش نضيفه وتقول لي الاكشن المفروض اعمله ايه برده ايه عشان افهم وكمان يبقى عندي ايجنت بيرسبت سيكونس تو ديت يعني عماله كل شويه تقدر تتعلم من افعالها السابقه يعني تقدر هي ادركت حاجات او عندها سيكونس مش مش عندها مثلا حاجه دلوقتي وخلاص بعد شويه لا هي عماله السيكونس ده بيعلمها انها لما عملت كده وقست البرفورمنس بتاعها كان كويس يبقى هي لما تعمل كدهاني هيبقى البرفورمنس كويس وهكذا تمام طيب يبقى الراشونال ايجنت دي لو انا اتكلمت عن الراشنال ايجنت دي يبقى لكل لكل بوسيبل بيرسبت عندي لكل لكل بيرسبت سيكونس موجوده عندي الراشنال ايجنت دي لازم تعمل سلكت تختار يعني اكشن معين متوقع ان هو يعمل ايه يزود البرفورمنس بتاعها بناء على ايه؟ زي ما احنا قلنا البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده عندها وانها بتبدا تبني نولدج عندها يعني اعتمادا على الايه الحاجات السابقه اللي حصلت معايا يبقى نقول الجزء ده تاني ان انا عندي حاجه اسمها راشونال ايجنت راشونال ايجنت دي معناها ان انا دلوقتي الايجنت دي بيكون عندها مجموعه من البيرسبت سيكونس اللي موجوده قبل كده تدر ادرك البيئه اللي حواليها ومجموعه من الادراكات السابقه وبعد كده عندنا كمان ان هي بتقدر تاخد اكشنز الاكشنز دي بتزود البرفورمنس بتاعها اعتمادا على الادراك اللي هي ادركته او مجموعه الادراكات اللي ورا بعضها اللي حصلت معاها وهي بدات انها تبني نولدج عندها وبدات انها تاخد اكشن صحيح وعقلاني تمام؟ طيب احنا مثلا عندنا دلوقتي راشنال ايجنت طيب انا اعتبر خالص ان انا عندي ماب الماب دي لرومانيا عندي بعض احتمالات انا عايزه اروح من مكان معين من بلد معينه لبلد معينه يا ترى لو رحت عن طريق حاجه سكه معينه ولا عن طريق السكه الثانيه طب عشان اروح من البلد دي للبلد دي لو رحت من السكه دي احسن ولا السكه دي فاذا لازم يكون عندها الايجنت دي بيرور نولدج يعني انت دلوقتي رمتني كده وخلاص على الاقل خالص تقول تديني بعض الانبوت اللي انا اقدر اعتمد عليه يعني تقول لي مثلا المسافه من هنا لهنا كذا يعني خليني اقول انا في بوخيرست مثلا عايزه اروح اي بلد تمام وليكن مثلا انا عايزه اروح حاجه نشوف حاجه بس ليها اكت من مسار ا مثلا لو انا عايزه اروح البلد دي ممكن امشي ازاي ممكن امشي كده كده صح وممكن امشي كده سوري اهو هنا فممكن امشي كده كده كده صح كده كمان طيب يا ترى انا لو ما عنديش بيرور نولدج انا مش عارفه المسافات بين البلاد فلازم انا يعني ممكن بقى ساعتها اتخبط واتعلم بقى من اخطائي بس لو انت مديني بيرور نولدج انا هقدر اخد اكشن فالاكشن ده هيحصل له ايه بقى هبدا ان انا احسب المسافات وبالتالي انا هوصل للاوبتيمال سوليوشن او الحل المثالي في الكلام ده بناء على المسافات اللي انت مديتها يبقى انت اديتني ايه؟ مجموعه من البيرسبتس ادركت اللي حواليا ادركت ان انا في انهي مكان وعايزه اروح انهي مكان فانت اديتني انبوت اديتني اوبوت اديتني سكه او بعض المسافات وانا بالتالي بدات ان انا اخد اكشن معين بناء على الكلام ده فالريشوناليتي عموما مختلفه عن ايه بقى مختلفه عن ان انا اقول ايه لا ده الحاجه دي بيرفكت او حاجه تامه ليه بقى لو انا دلوقتي عندي راشوناليتي مش معناها ان انا وصلت البيرفكشن لا خالص خالص انا ما عنديش كل الايه كل الحاجات المتاحه يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي لو بلعب كوتشينه ماشي انا عندي ادراك بايه عندي ادراك بايه في الكوتشينه عندي ادراك بقواعد اللعبه وعندي ادراك بورقي بس هل عندي ادراك بكل اللي حواليا دول ورقهم ايه الا انا كنت غشاش ده وضع ثاني انما انا كده لو هقول لك لو انا عندي ادراك باللي حواليا معاهم ورق ايه انا كده هوصل للبيركشن وهكسب الدور لا محال ليه ليه؟ لان انا عارفه هم الناس دي معاها ايه انما انا عندي جزء مستخبي جزء انا مش عارفاه فهو بيقول لك ايه؟ ان انت تبقى راشونالتي تبقى عقلاني معنى انك تاخد اكشن صح كل ما هو الا اللي بت عليك ان انت تعمل ماكسيمايز للبرفورمنس بتاعك انما مش معناه ان انت وصلت لبرفكشن خالص لا فهو بيقول لك الراشونالتي بيزود الاكسبكتد اوتكم انما البيرفكشن ده لا هو اصلا بيزود الاكتوال اوتكم ففي فرق بين الاكسبكتد اوتكم الحاجه اللي متوقعه تحصل وف بين فعلا ان انا هزود الاوتكم الاكشوال بقى اوتكم تمام عندها برض مصطلح تاني في موضوع الايجنت ده اسمه ايه الاستقلاليه دي معناها ايه ان هي دلوقتي بتقدر انها تتصرف طبقا لتس اون اكسبيرينس مش النولدج او الديزاينر او حضرتك انت اللي عاملها فمديها قرارات واضحه ومعينه انت هتمشي واحد انين 3لا انما لا هي خلاص بنت الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها وبالتالي بقى عندها حاجه اسمها استقلاليه انا همشي مع نفسي كده تمام طيب احنا عندنا الاكستريمز بتاعتي ايه يا اما انها تبقى نوومي خالص مالهاش اي ماشيه خالص رافضه الانفايرمنت والديتا وماشيه بناء على المبرمج بتاعها اقلها 1 زئ يساوي اين بتمشي فيه يا اما يبقى عندها كومبليت اتونميومي يعني انها تقدر انها ما عندهاش اصلا يعني مش ماشيه على قواعد ثابته هي بتاخد ديسيجن بناء على الاون اكسبيرينس بتاعتهم تمام يعني مثلا دلوقتي الطفل دلوقتي دلوقتي هو بيتعلم يسحف خلاص هو بيسحف بيعمل كرون فما ماشي عمال يسحف في الارض وهو ماشي بيسحف بيسحف هو خلاص بيبدا ان هو ايه ا يمشي ويقع عادي ما فيش مشكله وهو ماشي لقى حاجه قدامه قام جاي موقع المروحه على دماغه فتعور فبدا ان هو يبني اكسبيرينس ان هو المروحه دي انا مش هقرب منها ثاني لانها هتكسر دماغي المره الجايه فهو خد ديسيجن بكده فما فيش مشكله طيب المفروض ان انت بقى يبقى فيها بعض مش كل لان برده مش هينفع تديها استقلاليه تامه لا انا عايزه انها يبقى عندها جزء من الاستقلاليه مش تبقى يعني انا باخد جزء واخلي جزء هي مع الاكسبيرينس بتاعتها هيبقى عندها استقلاليه ايه استقلاليه كويسه يعني طيب انت قلتي لي في مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس ده عباره عن ايه كل حرف من دول يمثل حاجه محدده زي ايه مثلا البي يعني البرفورمنس ميجرمنت عندي الاي الانفايرمنت اكشوي ترز وكمان السنسورز ناخد مثال كده ونشوف ازاي هنقدر نحلل الكلام ده ونطلع الاربع حاجات دول يعني اول حاجه مثلا عندي اوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر عندي مثلا بارت بيكنج روبوت عندي انتراكتف انجلش توتر طب ده معناه ايه اول واحد ده مثلا بتاع الاوتوميتد تاكسي درايفر اللي هو انا عندي دلوقتي زي سيلف درايفينج كار كده بس ايه بس بتاع التاكسي اول حاجه لو جيت فكرت انا ايه الاداء بتاعي الكويس الاداء بتاعي ان الراجل ده يقدر يوصلني بسرعه صح طب افرض وصلني بسرعه بس مكسور دراع ولا مكسور ودن ولا مكسور رجل يبقى كده مش احسن حاجه يبقى لازم يوصلني بشكل امن الاول ده حاجه ويوصلني بسرعه مش يوصلني بشكل امن كده وقول لي استني بس كده اما ايه نهدي اهدي يا حاجه كده ونقعد خمس ست سنين في السكه دي كارثه تمام بشكل برده يمشي بشكل ججل يعني ايه يعني مثلا مش خلاص وصلني بسرعه وفست وكل ما يعدي قصاد كاميرا قرر يقلع يبقى ما بقاش فيه مثلا حزام او ما يبقاش او يرتكب مخالفه مثلا يجي في مكان 60 ا هيخليه مثلا يبقى 90 او مش او اني واي بقى حاجه يعني ارتكب مخالفه ما كمان يكون في كومفرتبل تريب يعني تكون رحله مريحه ما يبقاش مثلا مقعدني على الكراسي بايظه والبتاع مش متربطه العفشه والكلام ده وكمان يكون بيعمل ماكسمايزيشن البروفيتس او الربح بتاعي يعني مثلا انا دلوقتي شغلته وسير درايفينج كار ولا جاب لي مخالفات ولا جاب لي ماعرفش ايه وماشي امن والكومفورتبل تريب و حلو قوي وكل الحاجات والتفاصيل بوصل الناس بسرعه بس في الاخر تيجي تشوف البروفيت ما فيش فين يا عم الفلوس ما فيش فلوس ما فيش ما بيقفش الناس او ايا كان طيب في الحاله دي انا عندي الانفايرونمنت اللي هي الاي بتاعتي ان انا عندي ايه عندي الطريق طبعا عندي الترافيك الثاني عندي برده المشاه الكاستمرز نفسهم يبقى انا الانفايرونت بتاعي لازم اكون اوير بايه انا ماشي يبقى انا ماشي في طريق الطريق ده فيه مشاه لو انا مش اوير بالمشاه ممكن ادوسهم وامشي عادي ما فيش انا لازم ادرك البيئه اللي حواليا وكمان ادرك السيارات اللي حواليا ويبقى كمان ادرك ان الكاستمر ده اللي راكب معايا هيركب مش مثلا هو هيركب او او ركب ما اركبش لا لسه نزل ما نزلش كده كل الكلام ده اكون انا عارفه عندي بردهبقى الايه بقى اللي هي الاكتويتور اللي هي ايه اكتويتورز دي اللي هي عباره عن ايه عن الستيرين ويل اللي هي مثلا العجلات بتاعتي الاكسليتور البريك السيجنال الهورن كل الحاجات دي عندي اكتويتورز ليه لان كل ده بيتطلع اوتبوت يعني انا بمشي على عجلات بقدر ان انا اعمل اضغط على الفرامل يعني بتاعتي ا اقدر ان انا مثلا استخدم ال اللي هي لمبات الاشاره اللي هي الفوانيس بتاعه العربيه عندي البوخ بتاع العربيه تمام فدي برده ايه تعتبر اكتويتورز صح طيب ايه السنسورز بتاعتي انا بحس بقى وانا ماشيه بالعربيه بايه عندي مثلا الكاميرا عندي برده لو في سونار بيكشف لي الطريق ا عندي اي حاجه بقى سنسورز ثانيه خاصه بالجي بي اس عندي حاجات خاصه بالانج انجن والحاجات اللي موجوده في كمان كيبورد لو انت عايز بتدخل حاجه معينه او كده فبرده دي كلها انبوتس عندي مفيده جدا طبعا احنا لو اكلمنا عن عن التاكسي درايف كار ده يعني مش هنقول بقى يعني هنتكلم فيه كتير زي لو هي مثلا سيلف درايفين كار زي بتاع تسلا والكلام ده طبعا ده حاجه بسيطه احنا بندي فور اكزامبل عشان حضرتك تدرك البي اي اس عشان اعرف ان انا ده المعيار بتاعي اللي انا او الحاجات اللي انا بشتغل عليها ممكن يجي لك في الامتحان او في اي مكان حضرتك شغال فيه نك عايزك تحلل هذه المنظومه بتاعه اي حاجه ويبدا يقول لك اكتب لي البي اي اس بتاعتها طيب ماشي طيب عندنا برض لو انا عندي بارت بيكينج روبوت يعني روبوت بيجمع الاجزاء فلو جيت اتكلمت عن البرفورمنس بتاعي اقيسه هقول لك ان هو دلوقتي نسبه البارتس اللي هو قدر يجمعها في الكوركت بينز بتاعتها يعني مش ان هو هتقول لي اه ده جمع الاجزاء ماشي بس حط مثلا حاجه مكان حاجه لا يبقى يبقى انا مش بحسبها هو جمع ايه وحطها فين لا لازم الاثنين يعني مش جمعها جمع ايه وخلاص واحطها في البورد اللي قدامه لا ما هو كل مكان في البورد بيحط فيه حاجه فلو هو ما حطش الحاجه في مكانه الصحيح يبقى كده هو ما ما عملش وظيفته بشكل امن عندي الانفايرومنت اللي هي الايه البيئه البيئه برده طب هو ايه البيئه اللي حواليه اللي هي الكونف ير بتاعه الكونفايرت و بورت والبنز اللي موجوده عندك يعني البلت اللي هو الحزام والحاجه ماشيه عليه البنز بتاعتك ده كده ايه يبقى انا البورتس بتاعتي والكونفاير بلت اللي موجوده عندي والبنز اللي انا بحط فيها ايه البارتس دي طب الاكتويتورز الاكتويتورز بقى اللي هي انا شغال ازاي ايه الخارج ده او بعمل التاسك دي ازاي عن طريق ان انا عندي الجوينتد ارم وكمان الهاند ما هو انا عندي الهاند دي الايد اللي انا ببدا احط فيها البنز دي طيب وهي متوصله بمفاصل فالمفاصل دي تعتبر عندي الاكتويتورز برض طيب السنسورز بقى انا بشوف بايه بشوف بالكاميرا وجوينت انجل سنسورز كل دي برض حاجات تعتبر سنسورز عندي طيب الانتراكتف انجلش توتر توتر ده يعني ايه يعني مدرس خصوصي مدرس خصوصي ده معناه ايه بيشوف قصور اللي عندي والمفروض ان انا مطلوب منه ايه او ان هو البرفورمنس بتاعه انا بقيسه ازاي ان هو حسن لي مثلا ال يعني الولد اللي قدامي حسن لي مستواه فبقول مثلا ماكسمايز الستيودنت سكور اون تست يعني كان بيجيب 70% بقى بيجيب 90% معنى كده انا قست البرفورمنس اه المدرس ده شغال كويس فلو جينا هنتكلم هو ده سوفت وير صح مش هيبقى هارد وير يعني مش هنجيب روبوت بس الانفايرونمنت بقى ست اوف ستيودنتس يعني مجموعه من الستيودنتس اللي موجودين عندي دي البيئه المحيطه طيب الاكتويترز دي معناها ايه؟ معناها الطالب هيشوفني فين؟ هيشوفني على السكرين صح سكرين ديسبلاي عن طريق بقى ان انا بس مديه اكسرسايز سجنز وكوركشنز كده كل ده بيتم عن طريق السكرين وبرده ممكن عن طريق الايه؟ عن طريق السبيكر ان هو يقدر يشوف السبيكر او يسمع من السماعات الكلام اللي انا بقوله له طيب السنسورز بقى الكيبورد والمايكروفون انا ببتدي انا كطالب اعمل كده بالكيبورد والمايكروفون بتاعه طبعا النهارده كان انترودكشن عن الموضوع بشكل عام يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن يعني ايه مالتي ايجنت اتكلمنا عن اصلا بعد كده عشان اعرف المالتي ايجنت لازم اعرف الايجنت يعني ايه اتكلمنا عن الراشونالتي في الايجنت ازاي تبقى عقلانيه هل بتبقى عقلانيه بشكل كامل او لا طب ده بيكون بيركشن او لا واتكلمنا برض عن ان انا يبقى عندي ا هل هي تبقى فيها تبقى اوتونماس يعني او لا يعني يبقى فيها استقلاليه او لا الافضل ان اديها استقلاليه بشكل ولا لا اكلمنا عن مصطلح اسمه بي اي اس وكل حاجه فيهم بتمثل ايه وخدنا ثلاث امثله ان انا سواء عندي تاكسي درايفين كار سواء انا عندي برضو الانجلش توتر وكمان عندي المثال الثالث اللي احنا اخدناه اللي هو ايه ثواني افتكره معاكم كده اه البارت بيكنج روبوت ان شاء الله اشوفكم على خير المره الجايه والسلام عليكم
